   abstract = {The low frequency of nontuberculous mycobacterial infections, nonspecific symptoms for individual mycobacteria, and the lack of specific identification methods could alter correct diagnosis. This study presents a combined microbiology and molecular-based approach for Mycobacterium marinum detection in four aquarists with cutaneous mycobacterial infection. Simultaneously, ecology screening for M. marinum presence in the aquarists' fish tanks was performed. A total of 38 mycobacterial isolates originated from four human patients (n = 20), aquarium animals (n = 8), and an aquarium environment (n = 10). Isolate identification was carried out using 16S rRNA sequence analysis. A microbiology-based approach, followed by 16S rRNA sequence analysis, was successfully used for detection of M. marinum in all four patients. Animal and environmental samples were simultaneously examined, and a total of seven mycobacterial species were isolated: Mycobacterium chelonae , Mycobacterium fortuitum , Mycobacterium gordonae , Mycobacterium kansasii , Mycobacterium mantenii , Mycobacterium marinum , and Mycobacterium peregrinum . The presence of M. marinum was proven in the aquarium environments of two patients. Although M. marinum is described as being present in water, it was detected only in fish.},

   abstract = {Mycobacteriosis is a chronic bacterial disease causing an ongoing epizootic in striped bass Morone saxatilis in Chesapeake Bay, U.S.A. Prevalence of disease is high in pre-migratory fish, and multiple species of Mycobacterium spp. have been isolated. However, prevalence of mycobacteriosis in the coastal migratory population is unknown and is of concern to multiple coastal states, as disease-related mortality may impact the long-term health of the population. Histological examinations of spleens collected from fish caught by recreational anglers during the winter fishery in coastal North Carolina (2005-2006, n=249) and during the spring fishery in Chesapeake Bay (2006, n=120) indicated a low prevalence of mycobacteriosis (6.8% of all fish examined) in comparison to smaller, pre-migratory Chesapeake Bay fish. Genus-level PCR and subsequent sequencing of the 16-23S intergenic transcribed spacer (ITS) region revealed that all bacteria were phylogenetically related, but species is unknown. Location of survey, gender of fish, and total length of fish had no significant effect on prevalence of mycobacteriosis, parasitic granulomas, or the density of splenic granulomas (p > 0.05). These results may indicate that either granulomas resolve after Chesapeake Bay fish enter the coastal migratory population, or that there is disease-related mortality among pre-migratory Chesapeake Bay fish.},

Fish (n = 512 total, wt = 65 +/- 15 g) were inoculated intraperitoneally with 10(4) colony-forming units (CFU) g(-1) body weigth (BW) or a physiological saline solution (controls) and evaluated for 8 mo. Inoculated fish fed a low-ration diet (0.15% BW d(-1)) developed a severe, systemic infection characterized by a high bacterial load (>10(8) CFU g(-1) spleen) and poor granuloma formation, which commonly progressed to mortality by 6 wk. In contrast, inoculated fish fed an adequate ration diet (1% BW d(-1)) developed classic granulomatous inflammation of reduced severity and total body energy similar to that found in uninoculated controls (p > 0.05). After 4 wk, fish fed adequate rations maintained an equilibrium state throughout the study period, even though 10(6) CFU g(-1) spleen mycobacteria were consistently cultured. In a second study, reactivation of an acute inflammatory state was demonstrated by placing previously infected fish on reducing diets (0.073% BW d(-1)). In both studies, the energetic demand of this disease was only appreciable when associated with active, severe, inflammatory states. To our knowledge, this study is the first to demonstrate the interaction of diet and mycobacteriosis in fish.},

   abstract = {This paper is a review of the effects of stress on reproduction in fishes. I hope to further the development of the concepts of allostasis and hormesis as relevant to understanding reproduction in general and in fish in particular. The main contentions I derive in this review are the following: Stressors affect fish reproduction in a variety of ways depending on the nature and severity of the stressor. The effects are transduced through a hormonal cascade initiated by perception of the stressor and involving the hypothalamus-pituitary-interrenal axis, the catecholamines, and also cytokines. Mounting a stress response and resisting a stressor is an energetically costly process, including costs associated with allostasis, attempting to reset homeostatic norms. Responses in emergency situations (e.g., being chased by a predator or a net) can be different from those where fish can cope (e.g., being in a more crowded environment) with a stressor, but both situations involve energy re-budgeting. Emergency responses happen in concert with the onset of energy limitations (e.g., the fish may not eat), while coping with allostatic overload can happen in a more energy-rich environment (e.g., the fish can continue to eat). Low levels of stress may have a positive effect on reproductive processes while greater stress has negative effects on fish reproduction. The concept of hormesis is a useful way to think about the effect of stressors on fish reproduction since responses can be nonmonotonal, often biphasic.},

Tagging locations were the North Carolina coast, where 81 fish were tagged; Albemarle Sound and Roanoke River, North Carolina, where 97 fish were tagged; and Chesapeake Bay and tributaries, where 300 tags were applied. Catches by commercial and sport fisheries indicated that large striped bass concentrated on the coast of North Carolina in late fall and winter, on or near spawning areas for striped bass in North Carolina and Chesapeake Bay in late winter and spring, and along the coastn orth of ChesapeakeB ay as far as Massachusettsin the summera nd fall. Recapturesw ere made of 19 fish tagged on the North Carolina coast; 23 tagged in Albemarle Sound and the Roanoke River, North Carolina; 27 tagged in Chesapeake Bay and its tributaries; and 1 tagged in the Thames River, Connecticut. Some fish were recaptured near the tagging location but most of them migrated along the coast and were caught in other concentration areas during the season of greatest fishing pressure},

   abstract = {Several species of bacteria have been isolated from diseased striped bass, Morone saxatilis (Walbaum), in Chesapeake Bay. Mycobacteria species are of particular interest because of their association with chronic lesions in both fish and humans. The resulting disease in fish may be characterised by emaciation, inflammation of the skin, exophthalmia (pop-eye), ascites (dropsy), open lesions, and ulceration. The prevalence of mycobacterial infection in 217 striped bass in the Maryland portion of Chesapeake Bay was determined to provide evidence of decreased overall condition of fish affected by these bacteria. The density of the granulomas was higher in the spleen and head kidney than either the heart or liver, and appeared to be most closely associated with the presence of an external lesion. Thirty-eight per cent of the fish showed some sign of an external lesion. Granulomas appeared in at least one organ in 53% of the fish sampled regardless of the presence or absence of an external skin lesion. Condition factor was significantly higher for striped bass without external lesions (0.96) than those with lesions (0.82). Striped bass with no internal granulomas and no external lesion had the highest condition factor (0.99) and fish with granulomas and external lesions the lowest (0.81). Slopes of the regression loge weight (g) and loge length (mm) for striped bass with external lesions was significantly higher than those fish without external lesions and had a lower r2. The results suggest that striped bass that are infected with mycobacteria have decreased overall health.},

   abstract = {Control of reproductive function in captivity is essential for the sustainability of commercial aquaculture production, and in many fishes it can be achieved by manipulating photoperiod, water temperature or spawning substrate. The fish reproductive cycle is separated in the growth (gametogenesis) and maturation phase (oocyte maturation and spermiation), both controlled by the reproductive hormones of the brain, pituitary and gonad. Although the growth phase of reproductive development is concluded in captivity in most fishes-the major exemption being the freshwater eel (Anguilla spp.), oocyte maturation (OM) and ovulation in females, and spermiation in males may require exogenous hormonal therapies. In some fishes, these hormonal manipulations are used only as a management tool to enhance the efficiency of egg production and facilitate hatchery operations, but in others exogenous hormones are the only way to produce fertilized eggs reliably. Hormonal manipulations of reproductive function in cultured fishes have focused on the use of either exogenous luteinizing hormone (LH) preparations that act directly at the level of the gonad, or synthetic agonists of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRHa) that act at the level of the pituitary to induce release of the endogenous LH stores, which, in turn act at the level of the gonad to induce steroidogenesis and the process of OM and spermiation. After hormonal induction of maturation, broodstock should spawn spontaneously in their rearing enclosures, however, the natural breeding behavior followed by spontaneous spawning may be lost in aquaculture conditions. Therefore, for many species it is also necessary to employ artificial gamete collection and fertilization. Finally, a common question in regards to hormonal therapies is their effect on gamete quality, compared to naturally maturing or spawning broodfish. The main factors that may have significant consequences on gamete quality-mainly on eggs-and should be considered when choosing a spawning induction procedure include (a) the developmental stage of the gonads at the time the hormonal therapy is applied, (b) the type of hormonal therapy, (c) the possible stress induced by the manipulation necessary for the hormone administration and (d) in the case of artificial insemination, the latency period between hormonal stimulation and stripping for in vitro fertilization.},

The ecology of these mycobacteria outside the striped bass host is currently unknown. In this work, we developed quantitative real-time PCR assays for M. pseudoshottsii and M. shottsii and applied these assays to DNA extracts from Chesapeake Bay water and sediment samples, as well as to tissues from two dominant prey of striped bass, Atlantic menhaden (Brevoortia tyrannus) and bay anchovy (Anchoa mitchilli). Mycobacterium pseudoshottsii was found to be ubiquitous in water samples from the main stem of the Chesapeake Bay and was also present in water and sediments from the Rappahannock River, Virginia. M. pseudoshottsii was also detected in menhaden and anchovy tissues. In contrast, M. shottsii was not detected in water, sediment, or prey fish tissues. In conjunction with its nonpigmented phenotype, which is frequently found in obligately pathogenic mycobacteria of humans, this pattern of occurrence suggests that M. shottsii may be an obligate pathogen of striped bass.},

M. marinum caused acute peritonitis, followed by extensive granuloma development in the mesenteries, spleen and anterior kidney. Granulomas in these tissues underwent a temporal progression of distinct morphological stages, culminating in well-circumscribed lesions surrounded by normal or healing tissue. Mycobacteria were cultured in high numbers from splenic tissue at all times p.i. Standard Ziehl-Neelsen staining, however, did not demonstrate acid-fast rods in most early inflammatory foci and granulomas. Large numbers of acid-fast rods were present in granulomas beginning at 8 wk p.i. Between 26 and 45 wk p.i., reactivation of disease was observed in some fish, with disintegration of granulomas, renewed inflammation, and elevated splenic bacterial densities approaching 109 colony-forming units g-1. Infection with M. shottsii or M. gordonae did not produce severe pathology. Mild peritonitis was followed by granuloma formation in the mesenteries, but, with 1 exception, granulomas were not observed in the spleen or anterior kidney. M. shottsii and M. gordonae both established persistent infections in the spleen, but were present at densities at least 2 orders of magnitude less than M. marinum at all time points observed. Granulomas in the mesenteries of M. shottsii- and M. gordonae-infected fish resolved over time, and no reactivation of disease was observed.},

   abstract = {Spawning stock biomass per recruit (SSBR) estimates the expected lifetime reproductive potential of an average recruit (P), which is an important correlate of population growth potential. The ratio of the fished to unfished magnitude of P is the spawning potential ratio (SPA) and is a measure of the impact of fishing on the potential productivity of a stock. Currenluse of SPR merges concepts developed to quantify the compensation required for population persistence given anthropogenic increases in mortality with observations of stock productivity and SSBR for fisheries in the Western North Atlantic. It has a firm theoretical basis and is evaluated against yield per recruit and contrasted with pther traditional biological reference points. SPR is widely used in U.S. fisheries managed under the Magnuson Fishery Conservation and Management Act, usually in the context of a percentage of the unflShed SSBR. lis implementation is intended to be risk-aversive through selection of minimum acceptable levels above which stocks maintain acceptable productivity. The behavior of the underlying principles suggests SPR values below about 0.2 should be avoided unless thare is evidence for exceptionally strong density-dependence in the stock. Critical levels have typically been set in the range of 0.2 to 0.3 primarily based upon the experience in the northwest Atlantic.},

   abstract = {Dead zones in the coastal oceans have spread exponentially since the 1960s and have serious consequences for ecosystem functioning. The formation of dead zones has been exacerbated by the increase in primary production and consequent worldwide coastal eutrophication fueled by riverine runoff of fertilizers and the burning of fossil fuels. Enhanced primary production results in an accumulation of particulate organic matter, which encourages microbial activity and the consumption of dissolved oxygen in bottom waters. Dead zones have now been reported from more than 400 systems, affecting a total area of more than 245,000 square kilometers, and are probably a key stressor on marine ecosystems.},

   abstract = {Striped bass Morone saxatilis has a paradoxical record of distribution and abundance, including population declines in coastal waters and variable success of freshwater introductions. This record is analyzed for consistency with a hypothesis that striped bass are "squeezed" between their thermal and dissolved oxygen preferences or requirements. A commonality among diverse field and lab- oratory observations supports an inherent thermal niche for the species that changes to lower temperatures as fish age. This shift can cause local conditions, especially warm surface strata and deoxygenated deep water, to be incompatible with the success of large fish. Crowding due to temperature preferences alone or coupled with avoidance of low oxygen concentrations can lead to pathology and overfishing, which may contribute to population declines. Through a mixture of evidence and conjecture, the thermal niche-dissolved oxygen hypothesis is proposed as a unified perspective of the habitat requirements of the species that can aid in its study and management.},

   abstract = {Habitat space for a fish species is normally constrained by extreme temperatures and low dissolved oxygen concentrations that the fish avoid. Both latitudinal limits to a species' geographic distribution and availability of suitable habitat on the local level may be altered by climate change. During the next century, average temperatures are expected to rise globally, and rainfall is expected to decrease in mid latitudes and increase in high latitudes. The author has predicted some possible effects of climate change on distribution of anadromous and landlocked stocks of striped bass Morone saxatilis . The tenuous existence of striped bass along the northern coast of the Gulf of Mexico and in Florida will likely be jeopardized by regional warming and reduced streamflow. In many freshwater lakes, reservoirs, and estuaries, the existing summer constriction of suitable habitat by high temperatures and low oxygen concentrations may be aggravated by warming, altered streamflow, and increased hypoxia},

   abstract = {Mycobacterium marinum is a slow-growing pathogenic mycobacterium. It was first isolated by Aronson in 1926 from fish, fish mycobacteriosis or called fish tuberculosis is the common causative agent of bacterial disease in many species of freshwater and marine fish. M. marinum can infect wild fish, aquaculture and ornamental fish, and it has a close relative of the causative agent of human tuberculosis, Mycobacterium tuberculosis. The recently sequenced genome of M. marinum has been shown to contain several putative GntR regulators. This family named after gluconate regulator has a helix-turn-helix structure. Characterization of transcription regulators and their network is an important step towards the complete understanding of cellular physiology. The regulator of this family shares a similar and conserved N-terminal DNA-binding domain, but has a highly diverse C-terminal effector-binding and oligomerization domain. According to the heterogeneity, we classify the M. marinum GntR family to four subfamilies: FadR, HutC, MocR, and YtrA, and these regulators are encoded by 8, 3, 1 and 1 genes, respectively. Thus this study extends the annotation of M. marinum GntR family proteins, and can help to understand the pathogenic role of this family in M. marinum and facilitate future drug design against this pathogen.},

Caused by several species of the genus Mycobacterium, the disease has received considerable attention in recent years because of the discovery of new species in piscine hosts, epizootics in wild fisheries, and the ability of a few species to infect humans. The impact of this disease in aquaculture and the aquaria trade has been well reported and there is currently no widely accepted cure other than depopulation and facility disinfection. However, the impact on wild fisheries is poorly understood and may relate to species-specific interactions (host-pathogen) and possibly environmental stressors. In this review, much of what is known about mycobacteriosis in marine fish is summarized with particular attention to an epizootic in striped bass, Morone saxatilis, (Walbaum), in Chesapeake Bay, USA.},

Mycobacteria have been previously isolated from a variety of Chesapeake Bay fish species, and the current study was designed to identify potential host specificity and location fidelity of mycobacterial isolates. Mycobacteria were isolated from wild fish of the Chesapeake Bay collected from the Upper Bay, the Choptank River, Herring Bay, the Chicamacomico River, the Pocomoke River and the Potomac River in 2003-2006. Mycobacterial isolates were recovered from striped bass, Morone saxatilis, Atlantic menhaden, Brevoortia tyrannus, white perch, Morone americana, summer flounder, Paralichthys dentatus, spot, Leiostomus xanthurus, largemouth bass, Micropterus salmoides, channel catfish, Ictalurus punctatus, common carp, Cyprinus carpio carpio, spotted seatrout, Cynoscion nebulosus, killifish, Fundulus sp., blueback herring, Alosa aestivalis, American gizzard shad, Dorosoma cepedianum and American silver perch, Bairdiella chrysoura. Twenty-nine well-defined mycobacterial groups resulted from gas chromatography dendrogram clustering of isolates. The majority of groups included more than one host species and more than one site of collection. However, four groups contained only striped bass isolates, three of which were similar to M. shottsii. Therefore, multiple Chesapeake Bay fish species are colonized with multiple mycobacterial isolates, of which few appear to be host or location specific.},

The stressors taken into consideration were short-term starvation (up to 14 days), long-term cage rearing (1 year) and crowding-induced severe panic frenzy. Wild-caught individuals were used as a control group. Fish subjected to either severe panic frenzy or starvation exhibited a decrease in gonad mass and had significantly higher intensity of α atresia in the vitellogenic follicles (means: 78% and 58%, respectively; range: 36-100%) than either wild or long-term caged individuals (means: 32% and 30%, respectively; range: 19-44%). The extensive atresia in fish stressed by severe panic frenzy was observed as early as 24 h after the stressing event. The present study represents the first evidence of the extreme susceptibility of Atlantic bluefin tuna to severe acute stress during vitellogenesis; it also shows that starvation is associated with progressive reabsorption of vitellogenic oocytes.},

   abstract = {Pseudoloma neurophilia (Microsporidia) is a common disease of zebrafish Danio rerio, including those used as research models. We conducted a study comprised of 4 separate experiments to determine the effects of husbandry stress on preexisting and experimental P. neurophilia infections and the subsequent effects on survival, infection onset and intensity, fish growth, and reproduction. In fish (AB strain) with preexisting infections, stress or feeding cortisol significantly increased mortality over 7 wk compared to no stress or cortisol treatment. In contrast, no mortality was observed in fish (TL strain) experimentally exposed to P. neurophilia over 10 wk. A third experiment involved experimental exposure of AB fish to P. neurophilia and exposure to crowding and handling stressors. No mortality was associated with P. neurophilia regardless of stress treatment over a period of 20 wk. However, the onset of infection occurred sooner in stress-treated fish. Stress significantly increased the mean intensity of infection (described as xenoma area/spinal cord area in histological sections) at Week 20 post-exposure (PE). In fish with preexisting infections, myositis was significantly greater in stressed and cortisol-treated fish than those not stressed. With experimental exposure of AB fish, stressed and infected groups weighed significantly less than the control group at Week 20 PE. Regarding fecundity, the number of larvae hatched at 5 d post fertilization was negatively associated with mean infection intensity among P. neurophilia-infected and stressed AB fish. These experiments are the first to show empirically that P. neurophilia can be associated with reduced weight and fecundity, and that stress can exacerbate the severity of the infection.},

   abstract = {© 2016, Coastal and Estuarine Research Federation.This study evaluated the relative importance of the Narragansett Bay estuary (RI and MA, USA), and associated tidal rivers and coastal lagoons, as nurseries for juvenile winter flounder, Pseudopleuronectes americanus, and summer flounder, Paralichthys dentatus. Winter flounder (WF) and summer flounder (SF) abundance and growth were measured from May to October (2009–2013) and served as indicators for the use and quality of shallow-water habitats (water depth <1.5–3.0 m). These bioindicators were then analyzed with respect to physiochemical conditions to determine the mechanisms underlying intraspecific habitat selection. WF and SF abundances were greatest in late May and June (maximum monthly mean = 4.9 and 0.55 flounder/m2 for WF and SF, respectively) and were significantly higher in the tidal rivers relative to the bay and lagoons. Habitat-related patterns in WF and SF abundance were primarily governed by their preferences for oligohaline (0.1–5 ppt) and mesohaline (6–18 ppt) waters, but also their respective avoidance of hypoxic conditions (<4 mg DO/L) and warm water temperatures (>25 °C). Flounder habitat usage was also positively related to sediment organic content, which may be due to these substrates having sufficiently high prey densities. WF growth rates (mean = 0.25 ± 0.14 mm/day) were negatively correlated with the abundance of conspecifics, whereas SF growth (mean = 1.39 ± 0.46 mm/day) was positively related to temperature and salinity. Also, contrary to expectations, flounder occupied habitats that offered no ostensible advantage in intraspecific growth rates. WF and SF exposed to low salinities in certain rivers likely experienced increased osmoregulatory costs, thereby reducing energy for somatic growth. Low-salinity habitats, however, may benefit flounder by providing refugia from predation or reduced competition with other estuarine fishes and macroinvertebrates. Examining WF and SF abundance and growth across each species’ broader geographic distribution revealed that southern New England habitats may constitute functionally significant nurseries. These results also indicated that juvenile SF have a geographic range extending further north than previously recognized.},

   abstract = {a b s t r a c t Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) are an important tool for the maintenance of marine ecosystem func-tionality and health and ensuring the onward flow of beneficial ecosystem services that support human well-being. Social and economic factors influence whether and how stakeholders exploit resources or cooperate to conserve them. Environmental managers are now turning from designating MPAs to monitoring their effectiveness. Combining spatial analysis with quantitative and qualitative survey methods this research shows that an MPA (Lyme Bay, SW England) has had varying effects on the de-livery of the beneficial ecosystem service of leisure and recreation. In the survey years 2008–2011 dive businesses have increased their frequency of activity inside and outside the MPA and report an increase in turnover; though they perceive little or no effect of the MPA on business. Charter boat operators have seen an overall decline in the frequency of activity outside the MPA and an increase inside the MPA. They perceive that the MPA has increasingly had a positive effect on their business. Sea angling activity has declined at sites outside the MPA and increased at sites within the MPA, suggesting a redistribution of spatial activity. Diving activity has increased both inside and outside the MPA. Divers report that the MPA has influenced where they choose to dive. This corresponds to a potential increase in value of the MPA resource (represented as the proportional expenditure and associated turnover by these groups) of d2.2 million. This research demonstrates that the use of the resource has changed following designation and that MPAs can attract a greater proportion of the leisure and recreation expenditure and associated turnover to sites within the MPA boundary. Moving forward it is important to assess effects both inside and outside MPAs. Integrating high quality social science at MPA sites to track effectiveness can help to adapt and refine management strategies to reflect the needs of the stakeholders and support effective conservation.},

   abstract = {The interest in fishing-induced life-history evolution has been growing in the last decade, in part because of the increasing number of studies suggesting evolutionary changes in life-history traits, and the potential ecological and economic consequences these changes may have. Among the traits that could evolve in response to fishing, growth has lately received attention. However, critical reading of the literature on growth evolution in fish reveals conceptual confusion about the nature of 'growth' itself as an evolving trait, and about the different ways fishing can affect growth and size-at-age of fish, both on ecological and on evolutionary time-scales. It is important to separate the advantages of being big and the costs of growing to a large size, particularly when studying life-history evolution. In this review, we explore the selection pressures on growth and the resultant evolution of growth from a mechanistic viewpoint. We define important concepts and outline the processes that must be accounted for before observed phenotypic changes can be ascribed to growth evolution. When listing traits that could be traded-off with growth rate, we group the mechanisms into those affecting resource acquisition and those governing resource allocation. We summarize potential effects of fishing on traits related to growth and discuss methods for detecting evolution of growth. We also challenge the prevailing expectation that fishing-induced evolution should always lead to slower growth.},

The potential effects of these novel issues might not yet be fully recognized or understood by the global conservation community, and the issues can be regarded as both opportunities and risks. A diverse international team with collective expertise in horizon scanning, science communication, and conservation research, practice, and policy reviewed 100 potential issues and identified 15 that qualified as emerging, with potential substantial global effects. These issues include new developments in energy storage and fuel production, sand extraction, potential solutions to combat coral bleaching and invasive marine species, and blockchain technology. Aims of Horizon Scanning We have conducted an annual horizon scan of global conservation issues since 2010 with the aim of highlighting, by consensus, emerging topics that are not yet widely known in the conservation community but could have substantial effects on biological diversity worldwide in the medium to long term. Our iterative, transferable process of horizon scanning, which is designed to be both transparent and democratic, is carried out by a team with a wide range of experiences and areas of expertise. Our aim has been to focus attention and stimulate debate about these subjects, potentially leading to new research foci, policy developments, or business innovations. These responses should help to facilitate better-informed forward-planning. It is difficult to gauge the direct effects of our horizon scans on the research, policy, or business communities, except through personal communication and hearsay.

For example, fisheries targeting large individuals are expected to select for early maturation at smaller sizes, leading to reduced fecundity and thus also reduced fisheries yield. These predicted phenotypic shifts have been observed in several fish stocks, but disentangling the environmental and genetic causes behind them has proved difficult. Here, we review recent studies investigating phenotypic shifts in exploited populations and strategies for minimizing fisheries-induced evolution. Responses to selective harvesting will depend on species-specific life-history traits, and on community-level and environmental processes. Therefore, the detection of fisheries-induced evolution and successful fish stock management requires routine population monitoring, and a good understanding of genetics, relevant ecological processes and changing environmental conditions.},

   abstract = {The use of baited remote underwater video to remotely observe fish and generate indices of relative abundance has steadily gained acceptance as a fisheries management tool particularly as survey time series have matured. Because ‘capture’ for this gear is visually derived, fish can possibly be counted multiple times and therefore different methods of estimating site abundances have been developed. We compared the performance of two video abundance estimation techniques, MaxN and MeanCount, by generating relative indices of abundance using a delta lognormal model. We demonstrated high correspondence between standardized indices produced through the years analyzed independent of the species evaluated, indicating there was little change in the information content between indices. Despite the agreement between the indices, estimates for proportion positive and coefficient of variation (CV) showed a general reduction in precision when using the MeanCount method for all species analyzed. Systematic underestimation of proportion positives and high CV values generated using MeanCount is problematic for the use of that abundance estimation method. Individual-based modeling results confirmed that MeanCount is linearly related to true abundance, while MaxN showed a power relationship. However, the MaxN estimate became linear as the area observed was increased in the model from 25% to 100%, which suggests that syncing cameras and generating counts over the entire observed area would eliminate the asymptotic relationship and simplify the use of MaxN estimators. Better understanding of catchability for optical type gears would enhance understanding of the relationship between the generated index and true population abundance, and supply assessment scientist with a clearer understanding of how to incorporate these types of survey data into assessments.},

Precision of the video samples was reevaluated with data from 18 stations sampled during 1993 off Kaneohe Bay. The video index of the maximum number of opakapaka observed (MAXNO, the natural log-transformed mean of three camera drops) was best cor-related with the log of longline CPUE (r=O.79, P<O.OOI, n=15). Variation in the data for video MAXNO was nominally less than that of the longline CPUE. No monotone trend over stations was noted in samples from 1993. Sample sizes of 33 stations for longline and 18 stations for video would be necessary to detect two-fold changes in abundance of opakapaka at a site, based on our analysis ofthe two end positions of the 10 windward Oahu stations that had three quantitative deploy-ments. Reanalysis of power with data from the 1993 cruise indicates that a sample size ofapproximately 22 stations (<X:!=O.05) or approxi-mately 17 stations (~=O.11 would be necessary to detect twofold changes.},

   abstract = {Human harvest of phenotypically desirable animals from wild populations imposes selection that can reduce the frequencies of those desirable phenotypes. Hunting and fishing contrast with agricultural and aquacultural practices in which the most desirable animals are typically bred with the specific goal of increasing the frequency of desirable phenotypes. We consider the potential effects of harvest on the genetics and sustainability of wild populations. We also consider how harvesting could affect the mating system and thereby modify sexual selection in a way that might affect recruitment. Determining whether phenotypic changes in harvested populations are due to evolution, rather than phenotypic plasticity or environmental variation, has been problematic. Nevertheless, it is likely that some undesirable changes observed over time in exploited populations (e.g., reduced body size, earlier sexual maturity, reduced antler size, etc.) are due to selection against desirable phenotypes-a process we call "unnatural" selection. Evolution brought about by human harvest might greatly increase the time required for over-harvested populations to recover once harvest is curtailed because harvesting often creates strong selection differentials, whereas curtailing harvest will often result in less intense selection in the opposing direction. We strongly encourage those responsible for managing harvested wild populations to take into account possible selective effects of harvest management and to implement monitoring programs to detect exploitation-induced selection before it seriously impacts viability.},

We develop an age-structured food web model to explore some of the bioeconomic causes and consequences of fishing patterns. We illustrate some of the model behaviors using a food chain ecosystem, parameterized using species found in the northwest Atlantic. We explore the effects of different relationships between profitability (defined as total profit per unit fishing effort) and trophic level of the target species on ecosystem and fishing dynamics. Across the profitability scenarios we explore, different patterns in ecosystem and fishery dynamics emerge, with greater variability and depletion in ecosystem biomass, greater variability and less yield to the fishery, and more variable profit when lower trophic level are more profitable and subject to more intense fishing pressure. For all scenarios we calculate the mean trophic level of the catch (TLC) in each year (where trends in this metric are often assumed to be an indicator of fishing patterns and ecosystem health) and compare it with the mean trophic level of the ecosystem. The relationship between the TLC and trophic level of the ecosystem varies with the way in which the fishery develops, and also with the particular species, suggesting that the TLC may not be the best indicator of ecosystem dynamics.},

Here, we build a model to predict the evolution of anadromy and residency in an exploited population of brook charr, Salvelinus fontinalis. Our model allows for both phenotypic plasticity and genetic change in the age and size at migration by including migration reaction norms. Using this model, we predict that fishing of anadromous individuals over the course of 100 years causes evolution in the migration reaction norm, resulting in a decrease in average probabilities of migration with increasing harvest rate. Moreover, we show that differences in natural mortalities in freshwater greatly influence the magnitude and rate of evolutionary change. The fishing-induced changes in migration predicted by our model alter population abundances and reproductive output and should be accounted for in the sustainable management of salmonids.},

   abstract = {This essay comments on recent research on Darwinian fisheries science and on the future development of this field. From a practical point of view, the key question is: how fast are evolutionary changes caused by fishing happening? To answer this question, there is a need to understand intensities of selection generated by fishing, heritabilities and genetic correlations of the traits under selection, and whether the rates of change in traits predicted from this information are consistent with the changes observed. Although there is little doubt about the existence of phenotypic change in life-history traits of exploited fish stocks, there are few direct estimates of selection differentials caused by fishing. Results that are available, together with the relatively low heritabilities of life-history traits, suggest that the evolution caused by fishing occurs at a modest rate, and is likely to need a decadal time scale to be clearly observable. Given the pressing need for attention to fisheries in the short term, measures to control the longer-term evolutionary impact of fishing are most likely to be adopted if they also help to meet short-term objectives of management. With this in mind, the essay mounts a defence of large, old fish, the presence of which would be beneficial to stocks in the short term, and the conservation of which would set in motion selection for improved growth in the longer term.},

   abstract = {Individuals migrate to exploit heterogeneities between spatially separated environments to modulate growth, survival, or reproduction. We devised a bioenergetics model to investigate the evolution of migration distance and its dependence on individual states. Atlantic cod Gadus morhua ranges from sedentary populations to stocks that migrate several thousand kilometers annually. We focused on the Northeast Arctic cod stock, which migrates south to spawn. A linear relationship between migration distance and the expected survival of offspring was assumed, here understood as the prospects for future survival and development that a fertilized egg faces at a particular spawning location. Reasons for why it may increase southward include warmer water that increases development rates, and thereby survival, along the pelagic drift trajectory. In the model, ingested energy can either be allocated to growth or stored for migration and reproduction. When migrating, individuals forgo foraging opportunities and expend energy. Optimal energy allocation and migration strategies were found using state-dependent optimization, with body length, age, condition, and current food availability as individual states. For both a historical and contemporary fishing regime we modeled two behaviors: (1) homing cod returning to the same spawning site each year and (2) roaming cod with no such constraints. The model predicted distinct regions of locally high spawning stock biomass. Large individuals in good condition migrated farthest, and these also tended to mature later in life. The roaming cod spread farther south as they grew larger and older. Homing cod did not have this freedom, and spawning was generally concentrated along a narrower stretch of the coastline. Under contemporary fishing, individuals matured earlier at a smaller size, had shorter migrations, spawned over a contracted geographical range, and tended to be in poorer condition. The effects were most pronounced for the homing behavior.},

   abstract = {As a consequence of intense fishing pressure, fished populations experience reduced population sizes and shifts in body size toward the predominance of smaller and early maturing individuals. Small, early-maturing fish exhibit significantly reduced reproductive output and, ultimately, reduced fitness. As part of resource management and biodiversity conservation programs worldwide, no-take marine protected areas (MPAs) are expected to ameliorate the adverse effects of fishing pressure. In an attempt to advance our understanding of how coral reef MPAs meet their long-term goals, this study used visual census data from 23 MPAs and fished reefs in the Philippines to address three questions: (1) Do MPAs promote shifts in fish body size frequency distribution towards larger body sizes when compared to fished reefs? (2) Do MPA size and (3) age contribute to the efficacy of MPAs in promoting such shifts? This study revealed that across all MPAs surveyed, the distribution of fishes between MPAs and fished reefs were similar; however, large-bodied fish were more abundant within MPAs, along with small, young-of-the-year individuals. Additionally, there was a significant shift in body size frequency distribution towards larger body sizes in 12 of 23 individual reef sites surveyed. Of 22 fish families, eleven demonstrated significantly different body size frequency distributions between MPAs and fished reefs, indicating that shifts in the size spectrum of fishes in response to protection are family-specific. Family-level shifts demonstrated a significant, positive correlation with MPA age, indicating that MPAs become more effective at increasing the density of large-bodied fish within their boundaries over time.},

Here, we review recent studies investigating phenotypic shifts in exploited populations and strategies for minimizing fisheries-induced evolution. Responses to selective harvesting will depend on species-specific life-history traits, and on community-level and environmental processes.

The steepness of a stock-recruitment relationship is commonly defined as the fraction of recruitment of an unfished population obtained when the spawning stock biomass is 20% of its unfished level. We use a model of harvest-induced evolutionary change to understand how the steepness of the stock-recruitment relationship changes due to fishing. If the true spawning stock biomass is known, the stock-recruitment relationship changes little under fishing-induced evolution and there is little concern for fisheries management. When management is based on a total biomass - recruitment relationship, recruitment may be underestimated, which is also of little concern from a sustainability perspective. However, when the number of spawners - recruitment relationship is used to forecast recruitment, management practice that ignores the evolution of steepness may overestimate recruitment and therefore recommend catches that exceed safe biological limits. Using outdated maturity ogives underestimates spawning stock biomass, which results in steeper and higher stock-recruitment relationships as life histories evolve. Although of little concern for sustainability, this may pose challenges for practical fisheries management.},

In fishes, unprecedented reductions in abundance have been associated with unprecedented changes in harvesting and aquaculture technologies. Fishing, the predominant cause of fish-population collapses, is increasingly believed to generate evolutionary changes to characters of import to individual fitness, population persistence and levels of sustainable yield. Human-induced genetic change to wild populations can also result from interactions with their domesticated counterparts. Our examination of fisheries- and farming-induced evolution includes factors that may influence the magnitude, rate and reversibility of genetic responses, the potential for shifts in reaction norms and reduced plasticity, loss of genetic variability, outbreeding depression and their demographic consequences to wild fishes. We also suggest management initiatives to mitigate the effects of fisheries- and farming-induced evolution. Ultimately, the question of whether fishing or fish farming can cause evolutionary change is moot. The key issue is whether such change is likely to have negative conservation- or socio-economic consequences. Although the study of human- induced evolution on fishes should continue to include estimates of the magnitude and rate of selection, there is a critical need for research that addresses short- and long-term demographic consequences to population persistence, plasticity, recovery and productivity.},

Reserves, or no-take areas, have been proposed as a management tool for reducing fisheries-induced selection, but their effectiveness for migratory species has remained unexplored. Here we develop an eco-genetic model to predict the effects of marine reserves on fisheries-induced evolution under migration. To represent a stock that undergoes an annual migration between feeding and spawning grounds, we draw model parameters from Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua) in the northern part of its range. Our analysis leads to the following conclusions: (i) a reserve in a stock's feeding grounds, protecting immature and mature fish alike, reduces fisheries-induced evolution, even though protected and unprotected population components mix on the spawning grounds; (ii) in contrast, a reserve in a stock's spawning grounds, protecting only mature fish, has little mitigating effects on fisheries-induced evolution and can sometimes even exacerbate its magnitude; (iii) evolutionary changes that are already underway may be difficult to reverse with a reserve; (iv) directly after a reserve is created or enlarged, most reserve scenarios result in yield losses; and (v) timescale is very important: short-term yield losses immediately after a reserve's creation can give way to long-term gains.},

   abstract = {Worldwide depletion of fish stocks has led fisheries managers to become increasingly concerned about rebuilding and recovery planning. To succeed, factors affecting recovery dynamics need to be understood, including the role of fisheries-induced evolution. Here we investigate a stock's response to fishing followed by a harvest moratorium by analyzing an individual-based evolutionary model parameterized for Atlantic cod Gadus morhua from its northern range, representative of long-lived, late-maturing species. The model allows evolution of life-history processes including maturation, reproduction, and growth. It also incorporates environmental variability, phenotypic plasticity, and density-dependent feedbacks. Fisheries-induced evolution affects recovery in several ways. The first decades of recovery were dominated by demographic and density-dependent processes. Biomass rebuilding was only lightly influenced by fisheries-induced evolution, whereas other stock characteristics such as maturation age, spawning stock biomass, and recruitment were substantially affected, recovering to new demographic equilibria below their preharvest levels. This is because genetic traits took thousands of years to evolve back to preharvest levels, indicating that natural selection driving recovery of these traits is weaker than fisheries-induced selection was. Our results strengthen the case for proactive management of fisheries-induced evolution, as the restoration of genetic traits altered by fishing is slow and may even be impractical.},

Current knowledge of behavioural syndromes in fishes is reviewed with respect to five main axes of animal personality: (1) shyness–boldness, (2) exploration–avoidance, (3) activity, (4) aggressiveness and (5) sociability. Compared with other taxa, research on fishes has played a leading role in describing the shy–bold personality axis and has made innovative contributions to the study of the sociability dimension by incorporating social network theory. Fishes are virtually the only major taxon in which behavioural correlations have been compared between populations. This research has guided the field in examining how variation in selection regime may shape personality. Recent research on fishes has also made important strides in understanding genetic and neuroendocrine bases for behavioural syndromes using approaches involving artificial selection, genetic mapping, candidate gene and functional genomics. This work has illustrated consistent individual variation in highly complex neuroendocrine and gene expression pathways. In contrast, relatively little work on fishes has examined the ontogenetic stability of behavioural syndromes or their fitness consequences. Finally, adopting a behavioural syndrome framework in fisheries management issues including artificial propagation, habitat restoration and invasive species, may promote restoration success. Few studies, however, have examined the ecological relevance of behavioural syndromes in the field. Knowledge of how behavioural syndromes play out in the wild will be crucial to incorporating such a framework into management practices.},

The strength of experiments is in their ability to disentangle genetic from environmental differences. Common garden experiments have provided direct evidence of adaptive divergence in the wild and therefore the evolvability of various traits that influence production in numerous species. Most of these cases involve countergradient variation in physiological, life history, and behavioral traits. Selection experiments have provided examples of rapid life history evolution and, more importantly, that fishery-induced selection pressures cause simultaneous divergence of not one but a cluster of genetically and phenotypically correlated traits that include physiology, behavior, reproduction, and other life history characters. The drawbacks of experiments are uncertainties in the scale-up from small, simple environments to larger and more complex systems; the concern that taxons with short life cycles used for experimental research are atypical of those of harvested species; and the difficulty of adequately simulating selection due to fishing. Despite these limitations, experiments have contributed greatly to our understanding of fishery-induced evolution on both empirical and theoretical levels. Future advances will depend on integrating knowledge from experiments with those from modeling, field studies, and molecular genetic approaches.},

   abstract = {Managing fisheries resources to maintain healthy ecosystems is one of the main goals of the ecosystem approach to fisheries (EAF). While a number of international treaties call for the implementation of EAF, there are still gaps in the underlying methodology. One aspect that has received substantial scientific attention recently is fisheries-induced evolution (FIE). Increasing evidence indicates that intensive fishing has the potential to exert strong directional selection on life-history traits, behaviour, physiology, and morphology of exploited fish. Of particular concern is that reversing evolutionary responses to fishing can be much more difficult than reversing demographic or phenotypically plastic responses. Furthermore, like climate change, multiple agents cause FIE, with effects accumulating over time. Consequently, FIE may alter the utility derived from fish stocks, which in turn can modify the monetary value living aquatic resources provide to society. Quantifying and predicting the evolutionary effects of fishing is therefore important for both ecological and economic reasons. An important reason this is not happening is the lack of an appropriate assessment framework. We therefore describe the evolutionary impact assessment (EvoIA) as a structured approach for assessing the evolutionary consequences of fishing and evaluating the predicted evolutionary outcomes of alternative management options. EvoIA can contribute to EAF by clarifying how evolution may alter stock properties and ecological relations, support the precautionary approach to fisheries management by addressing a previously overlooked source of uncertainty and risk, and thus contribute to sustainable fisheries.},

Here, we theoretically study the interplay between neutral and adaptive evolution caused by fishing. An individual-based eco-genetic model is devised that includes neutral and functional loci in a realistic ecological setting. In line with theoretical expectations, we find that fishing induces evolution towards slow growth, early maturation at small size and higher reproductive investment. We show, first, that the choice of genetic model (based on either quantitative genetics or gametic inheritance) influences the evolutionary recovery of traits after fishing ceases. Second, we analyse the influence of three factors possibly involved in the lack of evolutionary recovery: the strength of selection, the effect of genetic drift and the loss of adaptive potential. We find that evolutionary recovery is hampered by an association of weak selection differentials with reduced additive genetic variances. Third, the contribution of fisheries-induced selection to the erosion of functional genetic diversity clearly dominates that of genetic drift only for the traits related to maturation. Together, our results highlight the importance of taking into account population genetic variability in predictions of eco-evolutionary dynamics.},

   abstract = {A stronger focus on natural mortality may be required to better understand contemporary changes in fish life histories and behaviour and their responses to anthropogenic drivers. Firstly, natural mortality is the selection under which fish evolved in the first place, so a theoretical understanding of effects of natural mortality alone is needed. Secondly, due to trade-offs, most organismal functions can only be achieved at some cost in terms of survival. Several trade-offs might need to be analysed simultaneously with effects on natural mortality being a common currency. Thirdly, there is scattered evidence that natural mortality has been increasing, some would say dramatically, in some fished stocks, which begs explanations. Fourthly, natural mortality most often implies transfer of mass and energy from one species to another, and therefore has foodweb and ecosystem consequences. We therefore analyse a model for evolution of fish life histories and behaviour, where state-dependent energy-allocation and growth strategies are found by optimization. Natural mortality is split into five different components, each specified as the outcome of individual traits and ecological trade-offs: a fixed baseline mortality; size-dependent predation; risk-dependent growth strategy; a fixed mortality when sexually mature; and mortality increasing with reproductive investment. The analysis is repeated with and without fishing. Each component of natural mortality has consequences for optimal life history strategies. Beyond earlier models, we show i) how the two types of reproductive mortality sometimes have similar and sometimes contrasting effects on life history evolution, ii) how ecosystem properties such as food availability and predation levels have stronger effects on optimal strategies than changing other mortality components, and iii) how expected changes in risk-dependent growth strategies are highly variable depending on the type of mortality changed. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

Moreover, field surveys are often stratified by time or geographic criteria relevant to humans, whereas fishes stratify by habitat variables relevant to them. If mechanisms underlying behavior are not explicitly understood, conclusions based on survey data can lead to biased inferences as to species-specific habitat requirements and preferences, as well as changes in stock size occurring over time. Because physiology is the transfer function that links specific environmental conditions to behavior and fitness, we argue great gains can be made through the integration of physiology and fisheries science. These are complementary disci-plines, albeit ones that generally function at very different temporal and spatial scales, as well as different levels of biological organization. We argue more  specifically  that  integrating  physiological approaches with behavioral studies and traditional fisheries survey data (where each approach develops hypotheses to be tested in the other) can mechanisti-cally link processes from cells through populations to place fisheries management in an appropriate ecosys-tem context. We further contend that population- and species-specific mechanistic understanding of physio-logical abilities and tolerances can significantly help to: improve stock assessments, describe essential fish habitat, predict rates of post-release mortality, develop effective bycatch reduction strategies, and forecast the population effects of increases in global temperatures and ocean acidification.},

   abstract = {Size-selective harvest of fish and crustacean populations has reduced stock numbers, and led to reduced growth rates and earlier maturation. In contrast to the focus on size-selective effects of harvest, here, we test the hypothesis that fishing may select on life-history traits (here, growth rate) via behaviour, even in the absence of size selection. If true, then traditional size-limits used to protect segments of a population cannot fully protect fast growers, because at any given size, fast-growers will be more vulnerable owing to bolder behaviour. We repeatedly measured individual behaviour and growth of 86 crayfish and found that fast-growing individuals were consistently bold and voracious over time, and were subsequently more likely to be harvested in single- and group-trapping trials. In addition, there was some indication that sex had independent effects on behaviour and trappability, whereby females tended to be less active, shyer, slower-growing and less likely to be harvested, but not all these effects were significant. This study represents, to our knowledge, the first across-individual support for this hypothesis, and suggests that behaviour is an important mechanism for fishing selectivity that could potentially lead to evolution of reduced intrinsic growth rates.},

While most studies agree that FIE is likely to be happening in many fished stocks, there are disagreements about its rates and implications for stock viability. To address these disagreements in a quantitative manner, we conducted a meta-analysis of FIE rates reported in theoretical and empirical studies. We discovered that rates of phenotypic change observed in wild fish are about four times higher than the evolutionary rates reported in modelling studies, but correlation between the rate of change and instantaneous fishing mortality (F) was very similar in the two types of studies. Mixed-model analyses showed that in the modelling studies traits associated with reproductive investment and growth evolved slower than rates related to maturation. In empirical observations age-at-maturation was changing faster than other life-history traits. We also found that, despite different assumption and modelling approaches, rates of evolution for a given F value reported in 10 of 13 modelling studies were not significantly different.},

   abstract = {Fish stocks experiencing high fishing mortality show a tendency to mature earlier and at a smaller size, which may have a genetic component and therefore long-lasting economic and biological effects. To date, the economic effects of such ecoevolutionary dynamics have not been empirically investigated. Using 70 y of data, we develop a bioeconomic model for Northeast Arctic cod to compare the economic yield in a model in which life-history traits can vary only through phenotypic plasticity with a model in which, in addition, genetic changes can occur. We find that evolutionary changes toward faster growth and earlier maturation occur consistently even if a stock is optimally managed. However, if a stock is managed optimally, the evolutionary changes actually increase economic yield because faster growth and earlier maturation raise the stock's productivity. The optimal fishing mortality is almost identical for the evolutionary and nonevolutionary model and substantially lower than what it has been historically. Therefore, the costs of ignoring evolution under optimal management regimes are negligible. However, if fishing mortality is as high as it has been historically, evolutionary changes may result in economic losses, but only if the fishery is selecting for medium-sized individuals. Because evolution facilitates growth, the fish are younger and still immature when they are susceptible to getting caught, which outweighs the increase in productivity due to fish spawning at an earlier age.},

A consequence could be that individuals surviving intensive harvesting, either as a result of behavioural plasticity and/or evolutionary change, exhibit increased average timidity. In the aquatic world, such effects are particularly well documented in passively operated fishing gears common to many commercial and recreational fisheries, such as angling, trapping or gill netting. We thus propose that an exploitation-induced timidity syndrome should be a widespread pattern in fisheries. Importantly, we argue that the syndrome can be associated with several ecological and managerial consequences for social groups, populations, food webs, fisheries and assessment of stocks. We suggest research priorities to deepen our understanding of how exploited fish populations behaviourally respond to harvesting.},

   abstract = {Harvest control rules (HCRs) have been implemented for many fisheries worldwide. However, in most instances, those HCRs are not based on the explicit feedbacks between stock properties and economic considerations. This paper develops a bio-economic model that evaluates the HCR adopted in 2004 by the Joint Norwegian-Russian Fishery Commission to manage the world's largest cod stock, Northeast Arctic cod (NEA). The model considered here is biologically and economically detailed, and is the first to compare the performance of the stock's current HCR with that of alternative HCRs derived with optimality criteria. In particular, HCRs are optimized for economic objectives including fleet profits, economic welfare, and total yield and the emerging properties are analyzed. The performance of these optimal HCRs was compared with the currently used HCR. This paper show that the current HCR does in fact comes very close to maximizing profits. Furthermore, the results reveal that the HCR that maximizes profits is the most precautionary one among the considered HCRs. Finally, the HCR that maximizes yield leads to un-precautionary low levels of biomass. In these ways, the implementation of the HCR for NEA cod can be viewed as a success story that may provide valuable lessons for other fisheries. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

Spawning adults in many wild Alaskan sockeye salmon populations have become shorter at a given age over the past half-century, but their age composition has not changed. These fish have been exploited by a gillnet fishery since the late 1800s that has tended to remove the larger fish. Using a rare, long-term dataset, we estimated probabilistic maturation reaction norms (PMRNs) for males and females in nine populations in two basins and correlated these changes with fishery size selection and intensity to determine whether such selection contributed to microevolutionary changes in maturation length. PMRN midpoints decreased in six of nine populations for both sexes, consistent with the harvest. These results support the hypothesis that environmental changes in the ocean (likely from competition) combined with adaptive microevolution (decreased PMRNs) have produced the observed life-history patterns. PMRNs did not decrease in all populations, and we documented differences in magnitude and consistency of size selection and exploitation rates among populations. Incorporating evolutionary considerations and tracking further changes in life-history traits can support continued sustainable exploitation and productivity in these and other exploited natural resources.},

   abstract = {Size-selective harvesting in commercial fisheries can induce rapid changes in biological traits. While experimental and wild harvested populations often exhibit clear shifts in body size and maturation associated with fishing pressure, the relative contributions of genetic and environmental factors to these shifts remain uncertain and have been much debated. To date, observations of so-called fisheries-induced evolution (FIE) have been based solely on phenotypic measures, such as size data. Genetic data are hitherto lacking. Here, we quantify genetic versus environmental change in response to size-selective harvesting for small and large body size in guppies (Poecilia reticulata) across three generations of selection. We document for the first time significant changes at individual genetic loci, some of which have previously been associated with body size. In contrast, variation at neutral microsatellite markers was unaffected by selection, providing direct genetic evidence for rapid evolution induced by size-selective harvesting. These findings demonstrate FIE in an experimental system, with major implications for the sustainability of harvested populations, as well as impacts on size-structured communities and ecosystem processes. These findings highlight the need for scientists and managers to reconsider the capacity of harvested stocks to adapt to, and recover from, harvesting and predation.},

We focus as much as possible on studies conducted under natural or seminatural conditions, as such field studies are most relevant to elucidating the ecological consequences of behavioral variation. Finally, we discuss the potential importance of consistent individual differences in behaviors to fisheries management and conservation, specifically examining consequences for recreational and commercial fishing, hatchery rearing, and stock enhancement.},

Three successive generations of artificially selected largemouth bass were produced from a single experimental study population. Within each generation, individual adult largemouth bass were identified as having either high or low vulnerability to angling through a series of controlled catch-and-release angling trials. Individuals of each vulnerability group (high and low) were then selected from that population for breeding to produce the next generation. The response to selection for vulnerability to angling increased with each generation; that is, the magnitude of the difference between the high- and low-vulnerability groups of fish increased with each successive generation. Realized heritability was calculated as 0.146 (r 2 = 0.995), indicating that the vulnerability of largemouth bass to angling is indeed a heritable trait. Our results indicate that recreational angling has the potential to alter the gene pool of wild fish populations, which may indirectly affect population characteristics such as survival, growth rate, and reproductive output as well as directly affecting angling success rates.

The potential contributions of demography, phenotypic plasticity and evolution to these trends were assessed. First, maturation trends were extricated from demographic effects and growth-dependent plasticity by estimating probabilistic maturation reaction norms (PMRNs). PMRN midpoints have significantly shifted downwards at most ages for cod, haddock and whiting, but not for Norway pout. Second, increased temperature and food abundance, loosened trophic competition and relaxed social pressure may also trigger growth-independent plasticity in maturation. Principal component regression of PMRN midpoints on annual estimates of relevant environmental variables exhibiting a temporal trend suggest that, despite some evidence of environmental effects, PMRN trends were mostly independent of growth-independent plasticity in haddock, whiting and male cod, but not in female cod. According to these findings, evolution of maturation, potentially in response to fishing, is plausible in haddock, whiting and male cod, but unlikely for Norway pout, and does not explain trends in female cod maturation. In agreement with life-history theory, the maturation response was larger in fast-growing, late- and large-maturing species exhibiting moderate reproductive effort.},

We compiled data from 11 049 loci across 140 species and found that allelic richness was lower in overfished populations within 9 of 12 genera and families. A multiple linear regression showed that allelic richness was on average 12% lower (P < 0.0001) in overharvested populations after accounting for the effects of body size, latitude and other factors. Heterozygosity was on average 2% lower (P = 0.030). Simulations confirmed that these patterns are consistent with a recent bottleneck in abundant species and also showed that our analysis likely underestimates the loss of rare alleles by a factor of two or three. This evidence suggests that overharvest drives the decay of genetic diversity across a wide range of marine fishes. Such reductions of genetic diversity in some of the world's most abundant species may lead to a long-term impact of fishing on their evolutionary potential, particularly if abundance remains low and diversity continues to decay.},

This study examines the models and the empirical evidence put forward in support of BH. It finds that the models used unrealistic settings with regard to life history (peak of cohort biomass at small sizes), response to fishing (strongcompensation of fishing mortality by reduced natural mortality), and economics (uniform high cost of fishingand same ex-vessel price for all species and sizes), and that empirical evidence of BH is scarce and questionable. It concludes that evolutionary theory, population dynamics theory, ecosystem models with realistic assumptions and settings, and widespread empirical evidence do not support theBH proposal.

The probabilistic maturation reaction norm (PMRN) has emerged as an important method to describe variation in maturation in wild fish. Because most PMRNs are based on age and size only, it is important to understand limitations of these variables in explaining maturation. We experimentally assessed (i) the sensitivity of age- and size-based PMRNs to unaccounted sources of plasticity, (ii) the role of social environment on maturation and (iii) the significance of estimating PMRNs early and late in the maturation process (initiation and completion of maturation, respectively). We reared male guppies (Poecilia reticulata) under laboratory conditions, subjected to two food levels and three different social cues. We found that growth and social environment affected the maturation in a way that could not be accounted for by their effect on age and size. PMRNs estimated for the initiation stage were less plastic (growth differences and social cues influenced the PMRN shape only little) than those for completion. The initiation of maturation is probably closer to the maturation 'decision' and allows determining factors influencing maturation decision most accurately.},

There is also direct and indirect selection on behavioral traits. Molecular genetic methods have so far contributed min- imally to understanding such fisheries-induced evolution (FIE), but a large body of literature studying evolution using phenotypic methods has sug- gested that FIE in life-history traits, in particular maturation traits, is com- monplace in exploited fish populations. Although no phenotypic study in the wild can individually provide conclusive evidence for FIE, the observed common pattern suggests a common explanation, strengthening the case for FIE. This interpretation is supported by theoretical and experimental stud- ies. Evidence for FIE of behavioral traits is limited from the wild, but strong from experimental studies. We suggest that such evolution is also common, but has so far been overlooked.},

A key question is whether this is due to insufficient reductions in harvest rates or the erosion of population resilience. Using a global meta-analysis of overfished stocks, we find that resilience of those stocks subjected to moderate levels of overfishing is enhanced, not compromised, offering the possibility of swift recovery. However, prolonged intense overexploitation, especially for collapsed stocks, not only delays rebuilding but also substantially increases the uncertainty in recovery times, despite predictable influences of fishing and life history. Timely and decisive reductions in harvest rates could mitigate this uncertainty. Instead, current harvest and low biomass levels render recovery improbable for the majority of the world's depleted stocks.},

These changes have been variously attributed to fisheries-induced evolution, inhibited adult growth rate due to oxygen limitation at higher temperatures, and plastic responses to density dependence or changes in ocean productivity. Here, we review the diverse underlying mechanisms by which plastic and evolutionary responses to climate change and fisheries are likely to produce similar life-history trends in harvested marine ectotherms, leading to faster life-histories with earlier maturation and smaller adult size-at-age. While mechanistically understanding these growth and maturation changes may be difficult, it is becoming clear that changing life-histories will lead to modified population dynamics, productivity and natural mortality of the affected species. We discuss how the observed and expected life-history changes could affect the assumptions and uncertainty within single and multispecies models currently used in marine ecosystem management, highlighting that models which allow for dynamic life-history traits often report significantly different estimates of stock biomass. Given that both climate- and harvest-induced life-history changes are likely to intensify and possibly amplify each other, there is an urgent need to adequately assess the implications of faster life-histories for marine ecosystem management. This is especially true for data-poor stocks, where growth and maturation are not regularly assessed. Targeted monitoring can be used to inform responsive management, but for improved sustainability outcomes, a precautionary approach to management that is robust to life-history trends is advised.},

   abstract = {Increased timidity is a behavioral response to exploitation caused by a combination of learning and fisheries-induced selection favoring shy fish. In our study, the potential for angling-induced change in fish behavior was examined in two marine coastal fishes exploited by boat recreational fishing in the Mediterranean (Mallorca, Spain). It was expected that the mean vulnerability to capture of surviving individuals would differ across a gradient of previous exposure to recreational angling and that this effect would be present in multiple species. The prediction received partial empirical support. Recreational angling intensity was correlated with enhanced gear-avoidance behavior in only one of the two study species, the carnivorous painted comber (Serranus scriba). By contrast, the omnivorous fish species in our study, the annular seabream (Diplodus annularis), did not differ in its behavior towards hooks in exploited compared with unexploited sites. These results suggest that recreational angling may contribute to patterns of hyperdepletion in catch rates because of increased timidity and associated reduced vulnerability to fishing gear in some exploited species. Such effects would lead to erroneous interpretations about the status of the fish stocks when assessed by fishery-dependent data and would negatively affect catch rates and quality of the fishery in the affected species.},

However, demonstrating that fisheries-induced phenotypic changes in the wild are at least partly genetically determined has proved notoriously difficult. Moreover, the population-level consequences of fisheries-induced evolution are still being controversially discussed. Using an experimental approach, we found that five generations of size-selective harvesting altered the life histories and behavior, but not the metabolic rate, of wild-origin zebrafish (Danio rerio). Fish adapted to high positively size selective fishing pressure invested more in reproduction, reached a smaller adult body size, and were less explorative and bold. Phenotypic changes seemed subtle but were accompanied by genetic changes in functional loci. Thus, our results provided unambiguous evidence for rapid, harvest-induced phenotypic and evolutionary change when harvesting is intensive and size selective. According to a life-history model, the observed life-history changes elevated population growth rate in harvested conditions, but slowed population recovery under a simulated moratorium. Hence, the evolutionary legacy of size-selective harvesting includes populations that are productive under exploited conditions, but selectively disadvantaged to cope with natural selection pressures that often favor large body size.},

In addition, learning to avoid future capture may always happen. Behavioural change caused by fishing may in turn affect the size-selective properties of angling. To test this prediction, field experiments with amago salmon (Oncorhynchus masou ishikawae) were conducted. We demonstrated that, as expected, large fish were more vulnerable than smaller individuals in a low fishing pressure (LP) stream and that positively size-selective angling was not (or no longer) present in a high fishing pressure (HP) stream.

   abstract = {Fishing is by nature and design selective, targeting species and sizes that yield the highest economic returns. Manipulation of the selective characteristics of fishing gear has been an important tool to influence the fishing pattern-for example, to minimise capture of certain age groups or to minimise catches of unwanted species. Selective removal of specific species and age groups in preference to others may contribute to changes in the species and size composition of fish communities, alter trophic interactions, and may lead to phenotypic or genotypic changes in harvested stocks. Balanced harvest (BH) is an ecologically based concept that aims to balance fishing mortality across a range of species, stocks and sizes, in proportion to their natural productivity in an ecosystem, so that the relative size and species composition are maintained relative to an unexploited ecosystem. The BH concept suggests that management practices and markets that promote size and species selective fishing should be reconsidered; as such it has been misinterpreted by some as an unselective fishing strategy. However, selectivity in fisheries is complex, and we introduce a multi-level concept of selective fishing to describe and discuss this unrecognized complexity, and examine the feasibility of a BH-type strategy. We conclude that a BH is an interesting concept that merits further exploration to better understand the challenges towards pragmatic implementation. Contrary to some interpretations of the BH concept, its implementation may require even more selective fishing gears and practices.},

In contrast to other scavenging opportunities involving pulsed resources (e.g. food falls), there is an asymmetric susceptibility to becoming hooked for species and size classes. The resulting effect may provoke behavioural changes in reef fishes through cognitive or phenotypic selective processes. We investigated the effects of angling pressure on the feeding behaviour and community structure of reef-associated fishes using a novel underwater video approach. Fish community and behavioural responses to simulated angling baits were assessed at paired sites of contrasting angling pressure at Amity Point and Ballina, on the east coast of Australia from late 2013 to 2014. Bait introduction differentially influenced trophic interactions of reef-associated communities according to angling intensity regime. Locations with higher angling pressure correlated with increased feeding hesitation among potentially capture-susceptible species, most notably Acanthopagrus australis. The feeding hierarchy of less dominant feeders and their interactions also differed compared with those exhibited under lower angling intensity regimes. Specifically, smaller opportunistic feeders (e.g. Microcanthus strigatus) that could utilise angling bait for dietary supplementation without risk of being hooked were able to maintain higher feeding ranks in areas subject to high angling pressure due to reduced interference competition from larger species, e.g. A. australis. We discuss the potential for complex ecological effects to follow from high-intensity angling activities and highlight the potentially confounding effects of using bait as a focus for fish assemblage monitoring.},

   abstract = {The establishment of marine reserves has been offered as an important fishery-management tool to complement the more traditional methods of size and bag limits, gear restrictions, closed seasons, and limitations on the number of fishers. In several parts of the world, 'no-take' zones, areas where fishing is forbidden, have been shown to benefit exploited populations, critical habitats, and community structure. Because fishing and bycatch mortality are all but eliminated in no-take areas, fish within these zones should live longer, grow larger, and be more fecund than those in fished areas. Despite these expected benefits, the creation of marine protected areas in U.S. waters is relatively new, and where they have been established, they have been small in scale. Size-distribution data can be a useful tool to assess the effectiveness of no-take reserves. The shape of length-frequency distributions is a result of recruitment, growth, mortality, and sampling. If sampling bias is comparable, a species' length-frequency distribution from different areas can yield important biological information specific to a given location. Since fishing mortality is selective towards larger fish and will be greater in fished areas than no-take zones, areas free of fishing mortality would be expected to contain more large individuals. Here, we report length-frequency patterns observed from an ongoing study designed to examine fish utilization of red mangrove (Rhizophora mangle) shorelines in southeastern Florida. In this effort, differences in the size structure of gray snapper (Lutjanus griseus), a species that is considered overexploited in this region, were revealed between an area closed to fishing and in surrounding waters open to recreational fishing.},

Owing to this combination of features, PMRNs allow many effects of phenotypic plasticity to be stripped away from the description of maturation schedules, so that residual trends are suggestive of genetic adaptation in maturation schedules.

   abstract = {One of the proposed benefits of marine protected areas (MPAs) is to conserve genetic diversity for life-history traits and to restore some semblance of the life history that was expressed before intense exploitation. Strong size-selective mortality from fishing has promoted an earlier age and smaller size at maturity in many species and a concomitant reduction in subsequent adult body sizes. These attributes are less economically desirable than those of fish from less heavily exploited stocks. We attempted to determine whether the establishment of marine protected areas, and the resulting relaxation of the direc-tional selection produced by fishing mortality, would promote a substantial restoration of later ages at maturity. Our quantitative genetic models, calibrated with historical data from Gulf of Mexico popu\ationtof red snapper, Lutjanus campechanus, indicated that adequate variation should remain for life-history traits like age at maturity to respond to new fitness profiles. Marine species with planktonic 1arvac, including most economi-cally important fIShes, have high gene-flow rates that will preclude genetic differentia-tion between the no-take MPAs and the rest of the population. Any changes in the life history that are promoted by the n()-take area may therefore ramify through the entire population. The establishment of no-take MPAs will promote substantial increases in the age at maturity ifrecruitmcnt into them is not limited by density-dependent mortality. If it is, the benefit of n()-take areas for increasing the age at maturity will be decreased. The no-take MPAs must serve as the major source of recruits for nearby fishing areas to produce the proposed benefits. The creation of MPAs will not replace the benefits of limiting age or size biases in harvesting by traditional fisheries management. The global decline in quantity and quality of fishing stocks has created a need for new methods of stock management (Botsford et al., 1997). Marine protected areas (MPAs) and fishing no-take zones are proving to be valuable tools for management of marine fiShery resources (Roberts, 1997; Allison et al., 1998; Lauck et al:, 1998). The proposed virtues of MPAs include protection of spawning stock, elevation of recruitment rates, maintenance of the age and size structures of stocks, and preservation of a balance in the frequencies of predatory and prey species (Ballantine, 1991; Bohnsack, 1992; Gubbay, 1995; Shackell and Willison, 1995; Bohnsack and Ault, 1996). One possible benefit of no-take reserves that has received little attention is the protection of genetic resources for life-history patterns within stocks (Plan Development Team, 1990). This benefit is re-lated to the attempt to conserve stock structure, as indicated by molecular genetic mark-ers (Avise, 1998), but is distinct in referring to the genetic basis of the attributes of indi-vidual fiSh that make them economically desirable and sustain higher population num-bers (Stokes et al., 1993). The most important life-history characters for fishery stocks include the size and age at which individuals mature, the distribution of reproductive effort during life, and age-specific survivorship. Changes in these traits can change the size and age structure of a stock, altering its population dynamics and economic value. For example, a decrease in age at maturity appears to entail maturation at smaller sizes and an overall decrease in the adult body-size distribution (Trippel, 1995). Although earlier maturation can be},

The IUCN World Commission on Protected Areas under its programme for the marine biome (WCPA Marine) and the World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF) both work throughout the world to support MPAs, their managers and con- stituents. In keeping with their missions, the two organizations jointly formed the MPA Management Effectiveness Initiative (MPA MEI) in 2000 with four main objectives: 1. develop a set of marine-specific natural and social indicators to evaluate MPA management effectiveness with expert input from around the world; 2. develop a process for conducting an evaluation in the form of an easy-to-use guidebook, incorporating insight and experience from international peer review; 3. field-test and ground-truth a draft of the guidebook process and indicator methods at MPA sites operating in diverse conditions around the world; and 4. encourage and support managers and practitioners to use the revised evaluation methodology and guidebook to adaptively manage their MPAs and increase effectiveness.},

   abstract = {Many marine populations and ecosystems have experienced strong historical depletions, yet reports of recoveries are increasing. Here, we review the growing research on marine recoveries to reveal how common recovery is, its magnitude, timescale and major drivers. Overall, 10-50% of depleted populations and ecosystems show some recovery, but rarely to former levels of abundance. In addition, recovery can take many decades for long-lived species and complex ecosystems. Major drivers of recovery include the reduction of human impacts, especially exploitation, habitat loss and pollution, combined with favorable life-history and environmental conditions. Awareness, legal protection and enforcement of management plans are also crucial. Learning from historical recovery successes and failures is essential for implementing realistic conservation goals and promising management strategies. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

   abstract = {The status of fisheries around the world is controversial, with some of the most prominent fisheries scientists often divided into two camps, one that is more supportive of fishing (e.g., Hilborn, 2006) and one that is more supportive of conservation (e.g., Pauly, 2009). There are various definitions of Marine Protected Areas (MPAs), from strict no-take areas to " marine managed areas " which are not necessarily completely closed all the time. Here, I examine some of the arguments about MPAs, with particular attention to coral reef fisheries, and by MPA I refer mainly to no-take areas. There are now 7 billion people and the number is increasing, and fisheries are a critical protein source for many. The global fish catch is now so large it is limited by global ocean primary productivity (Chassot et al., 2010). Meantime, fisheries management has had some spectacular failures. Canada had world class fishery experts who proclaimed the cod fishery to be healthy and yet it collapsed, losing a $2 billion a year fishery (Kurlanski, 2010), which is only now recovering decades later. Some fisheries scientists show signs of irritation at the repetition of such stories, calling them the " litany " . Some complain that people still refer to papers that reported that the world's big predatory fish (like tuna and cod) are 80% depleted, maintaining that such figures were not based on strong science (it was not a stock assess-ment). They have written that there are at least 3 other major myths about fisheries commonly cited by the press and provide documenta-tion that the myths are wrong (Hilborn, 2016). Several of those with more fisheries-supportive views joined with those who have more conservationist views to review the large fisheries of the world in a paper which found that there were fisheries that are overfished, others that are fully fished, those that are in recovery; some in all categories (Worm, et al., 2009). Recently, another paper has reported that a survey of 75% of the world's fisheries revealed that the " Current status is highly heterogeneous—the median fishery is in poor health (overfished, with further overfishing occurring), although 32% of fisheries are in good biological, although not necessarily economic, condition " (Costello et al., 2016). This paper was another collaboration between those with the two viewpoints and which has been accepted or praised by both sides (Howard, 2016), giving it strong credibility. Other recent papers have pointed out that there are few fisheries left that are not fully fished, and a recent paper (Pauly and Zeller, 2016) presents data showing that the total world fish catch has been declining. MPA advocates say that protecting a certain proportion of the area protects a proportion of the total fish stock, insuring that a species doesn't become badly overfished. Fisheries scientists have criticized MPAs saying that they decrease total fish catch by closing off areas to fishing, cause hardship to fishermen who likely have to go farther and to more dangerous areas to fish, and which cause fishing effort to be concentrated into a smaller area, thus depleting those fish faster. These arguments appear to be based not on empirical data, but more on a series of assumptions such as that closing fishing areas causes total fish catch to decrease, fishermen to have to go farther, and that fishing effort stays constant and depletes fish in the open areas faster. On coral reefs, fishermen sometimes move their effort to just outside the MPA boundaries, presumably because they hope to catch more of the " spillover " fish there. Concentrating fishing efforts near MPA bound-aries may mean that the areas open to fishing might not become more overfished. Healthier populations in an MPA with larger females producing more eggs could support populations outside the MPA because the number of eggs is exponentially larger in larger fish, and total recruitment can be increased with just a few more very large individuals in an MPA (outside the MPA fishing removes most large individuals). Fisheries scientists point out that MPAs work best on fish species that are sedentary, because those fish don't swim far enough for more than a small proportion to swim outside the MPA. However, that means that their criticisms of MPAs are not so relevant to coral reefs, where most fish species are relatively sedentary (Green et al., 2015). MPAs may work well with coral reef fish even if they don't work well},

Spatial and seasonal community structure differences were analyzed for small-bodied and large-bodied nekton collected by fisheries-independent monitoring from 2006 through 2009 in the northeastern basins of Florida Bay. The small-bodied nekton community was dominated by resident fish that may be indicators of ecosystem health because they spend their lives within the bay and are not directly influenced by human harvest; the large-bodied nekton community was dominated by transient and, in some cases, economically important species. Differences in community structure revealed a gradient in similarity that was associated with freshwater influence, as determined by salinity variability over the study period. These observed changes associated with salinity regimes within and between basins underscore the importance of monitoring communities before and after alterations in freshwater inflow.},

   abstract = {This paper outlines an approach to natural resource management that incorporates multiple objectives for protected area management within a decision-making framework. Both regulators and other major stakeholders are directly incorporated into the approach to enhance decision-making processes. We call this approach trade-off analysis. The approach uses a framework based on multi-criteria analysis (MCA) but involves stakeholders at all stages. This holistic approach is appropriate for multiple use, complex systems such as marine protected areas (MPAs), where many different users are apparently in conflict and where linkages and feedbacks between different aspects of the ecosystem and economy exist. The paper applies trade-off analysis to the case of Buccoo Reef Marine Park (BRMP) in Tobago. Stakeholder analysis is undertaken, and social, economic and ecological criteria identified. The impacts of four different development scenarios are evaluated for these criteria. Stakeholders are asked to weight different criteria and then the outcomes of different stakeholder weightings in the MCA are used to explore different management options. For BRMP, the MCA suggests consensus around development options characterised as limited tourism development for the area surrounding the park in association with the implementation of complementary environmental management. The approach has been used to enhance stakeholder involvement in decision-making and develop consensus-based approaches to management of the MPA.},

   abstract = {The interest in fishing-induced life-history evolution has been growing in the last decade, in part because of the increasing number of studies suggesting evolutionary changes in life-history traits, and the potential ecological and economic consequences these changes may have. Among the traits that could evolve in response to fishing, growth has lately received attention. However, critical reading of the literature on growth evolution in fish reveals conceptual confusion about the nature of 'growth' itself as an evolving trait, and about the different ways fishing can affect growth and size-at-age of fish, both on ecological and on evolutionary time-scales. It is important to separate the advantages of being big and the costs of growing to a large size, particularly when studying life-history evolution. In this review, we explore the selection pressures on growth and the resultant evolution of growth from a mechanistic viewpoint. We define important concepts and outline the processes that must be accounted for before observed phenotypic changes can be ascribed to growth evolution. When listing traits that could be traded-off with growth rate, we group the mechanisms into those affecting resource acquisition and those governing resource allocation. We summarize potential effects of fishing on traits related to growth and discuss methods for detecting evolution of growth. We also challenge the prevailing expectation that fishing-induced evolution should always lead to slower growth.},

However, with a large proportion of these MPAs being no more than paper parks, it is important to be able to evaluate MPA success, determined by improvements to biophysical, socio-economic and governance conditions. In this study a systematic literature review was conducted to determine the most frequently used indicators of MPA success. These were then applied to a case study to demonstrate how success can be evaluated. The fifteen most frequently used indicators included species abundance, level of stakeholder participation and the existence of a decision-making and management body. Using the indicator framework with a traffic light system, we demon-strate how an MPA can be evaluated in terms of how well it performs against the indicators using secondary data from the literature. The framework can be used flexibly. For example, where no MPA data currently exist, the framework can be populated by qualitative data provided by local stakeholder knowledge. This system provides a cost-effective and straightforward method for managers and decision-makers to determine the level of success of any MPA and identify areas of weakness. However, given the variety of motivations for MPA establishment, this success needs to be determined in the context of the original management objectives of the MPA with greater weighting being placed on those objectives where appropriate.},

Here, we theoretically study the interplay between neutral and adaptive evolution caused by fishing. An individual-based eco-genetic model is devised that includes neutral and functional loci in a realistic ecological setting. In line with theoretical expectations, we find that fishing induces evolution towards slow growth, early maturation at small size and higher reproductive investment. We show, first, that the choice of genetic model (based on either quantitative genetics or gametic inheritance) influences the evolutionary recovery of traits after fishing ceases. Second, we analyse the influence of three factors possibly involved in the lack of evolutionary recovery: the strength of selection, the effect of genetic drift and the loss of adaptive potential. We find that evolutionary recovery is hampered by an association of weak selection differentials with reduced additive genetic variances. Third, the contribution of fisheries-induced selection to the erosion of functional genetic diversity clearly dominates that of genetic drift only for the traits related to maturation. Together, our results highlight the importance of taking into account population genetic variability in predictions of eco-evolutionary dynamics.},

Spawning adults in many wild Alaskan sockeye salmon populations have become shorter at a given age over the past half-century, but their age composition has not changed. These fish have been exploited by a gillnet fishery since the late 1800s that has tended to remove the larger fish. Using a rare, long-term dataset, we estimated probabilistic maturation reaction norms (PMRNs) for males and females in nine populations in two basins and correlated these changes with fishery size selection and intensity to determine whether such selection contributed to microevolutionary changes in maturation length. PMRN midpoints decreased in six of nine populations for both sexes, consistent with the harvest. These results support the hypothesis that environmental changes in the ocean (likely from competition) combined with adaptive microevolution (decreased PMRNs) have produced the observed life-history patterns. PMRNs did not decrease in all populations, and we documented differences in magnitude and consistency of size selection and exploitation rates among populations. Incorporating evolutionary considerations and tracking further changes in life-history traits can support continued sustainable exploitation and productivity in these and other exploited natural resources.},

   abstract = {Managing fisheries resources to maintain healthy ecosystems is one of the main goals of the ecosystem approach to fisheries (EAF). While a number of international treaties call for the implementation of EAF, there are still gaps in the underlying methodology. One aspect that has received substantial scientific attention recently is fisheries-induced evolution (FIE). Increasing evidence indicates that intensive fishing has the potential to exert strong directional selection on life-history traits, behaviour, physiology, and morphology of exploited fish. Of particular concern is that reversing evolutionary responses to fishing can be much more difficult than reversing demographic or phenotypically plastic responses. Furthermore, like climate change, multiple agents cause FIE, with effects accumulating over time. Consequently, FIE may alter the utility derived from fish stocks, which in turn can modify the monetary value living aquatic resources provide to society. Quantifying and predicting the evolutionary effects of fishing is therefore important for both ecological and economic reasons. An important reason this is not happening is the lack of an appropriate assessment framework. We therefore describe the evolutionary impact assessment (EvoIA) as a structured approach for assessing the evolutionary consequences of fishing and evaluating the predicted evolutionary outcomes of alternative management options. EvoIA can contribute to EAF by clarifying how evolution may alter stock properties and ecological relations, support the precautionary approach to fisheries management by addressing a previously overlooked source of uncertainty and risk, and thus contribute to sustainable fisheries.},

   abstract = {Behavioral responses of fishes to variabil-ity in environmental conditions and habitat quality are central to population-level demographic processes. Although field surveys can correlate abundance to habitat variables (physiochemical, biotic, and struc-tural), they cannot provide mechanistic explanations. Moreover, field surveys are often stratified by time or geographic criteria relevant to humans, whereas fishes stratify by habitat variables relevant to them. If mechanisms underlying behavior are not explicitly understood, conclusions based on survey data can lead to biased inferences as to species-specific habitat requirements and preferences, as well as changes in stock size occurring over time. Because physiology is the transfer function that links specific environmental conditions to behavior and fitness, we argue great gains can be made through the integration of physiology and fisheries science. These are complementary disci-plines, albeit ones that generally function at very different temporal and spatial scales, as well as different levels of biological organization. We argue more  specifically  that  integrating  physiological approaches with behavioral studies and traditional fisheries survey data (where each approach develops hypotheses to be tested in the other) can mechanisti-cally link processes from cells through populations to place fisheries management in an appropriate ecosys-tem context. We further contend that population- and species-specific mechanistic understanding of physio-logical abilities and tolerances can significantly help to: improve stock assessments, describe essential fish habitat, predict rates of post-release mortality, develop effective bycatch reduction strategies, and forecast the population effects of increases in global temperatures and ocean acidification.},

   abstract = {A number of theoretical models, experimental studies and time-series studies of wild fish have explored the presence and magnitude of fisheries-induced evolution (FIE). While most studies agree that FIE is likely to be happening in many fished stocks, there are disagreements about its rates and implications for stock viability. To address these disagreements in a quantitative manner, we conducted a meta-analysis of FIE rates reported in theoretical and empirical studies. We discovered that rates of phenotypic change observed in wild fish are about four times higher than the evolutionary rates reported in modelling studies, but correlation between the rate of change and instantaneous fishing mortality (F) was very similar in the two types of studies. Mixed-model analyses showed that in the modelling studies traits associated with reproductive investment and growth evolved slower than rates related to maturation. In empirical observations age-at-maturation was changing faster than other life-history traits. We also found that, despite different assumption and modelling approaches, rates of evolution for a given F value reported in 10 of 13 modelling studies were not significantly different.},

   abstract = {Harvest control rules (HCRs) have been implemented for many fisheries worldwide. However, in most instances, those HCRs are not based on the explicit feedbacks between stock properties and economic considerations. This paper develops a bio-economic model that evaluates the HCR adopted in 2004 by the Joint Norwegian-Russian Fishery Commission to manage the world's largest cod stock, Northeast Arctic cod (NEA). The model considered here is biologically and economically detailed, and is the first to compare the performance of the stock's current HCR with that of alternative HCRs derived with optimality criteria. In particular, HCRs are optimized for economic objectives including fleet profits, economic welfare, and total yield and the emerging properties are analyzed. The performance of these optimal HCRs was compared with the currently used HCR. This paper show that the current HCR does in fact comes very close to maximizing profits. Furthermore, the results reveal that the HCR that maximizes profits is the most precautionary one among the considered HCRs. Finally, the HCR that maximizes yield leads to un-precautionary low levels of biomass. In these ways, the implementation of the HCR for NEA cod can be viewed as a success story that may provide valuable lessons for other fisheries. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

   abstract = {Fish stocks experiencing high fishing mortality show a tendency to mature earlier and at a smaller size, which may have a genetic component and therefore long-lasting economic and biological effects. To date, the economic effects of such ecoevolutionary dynamics have not been empirically investigated. Using 70 y of data, we develop a bioeconomic model for Northeast Arctic cod to compare the economic yield in a model in which life-history traits can vary only through phenotypic plasticity with a model in which, in addition, genetic changes can occur. We find that evolutionary changes toward faster growth and earlier maturation occur consistently even if a stock is optimally managed. However, if a stock is managed optimally, the evolutionary changes actually increase economic yield because faster growth and earlier maturation raise the stock's productivity. The optimal fishing mortality is almost identical for the evolutionary and nonevolutionary model and substantially lower than what it has been historically. Therefore, the costs of ignoring evolution under optimal management regimes are negligible. However, if fishing mortality is as high as it has been historically, evolutionary changes may result in economic losses, but only if the fishery is selecting for medium-sized individuals. Because evolution facilitates growth, the fish are younger and still immature when they are susceptible to getting caught, which outweighs the increase in productivity due to fish spawning at an earlier age.},

   abstract = {A stronger focus on natural mortality may be required to better understand contemporary changes in fish life histories and behaviour and their responses to anthropogenic drivers. Firstly, natural mortality is the selection under which fish evolved in the first place, so a theoretical understanding of effects of natural mortality alone is needed. Secondly, due to trade-offs, most organismal functions can only be achieved at some cost in terms of survival. Several trade-offs might need to be analysed simultaneously with effects on natural mortality being a common currency. Thirdly, there is scattered evidence that natural mortality has been increasing, some would say dramatically, in some fished stocks, which begs explanations. Fourthly, natural mortality most often implies transfer of mass and energy from one species to another, and therefore has foodweb and ecosystem consequences. We therefore analyse a model for evolution of fish life histories and behaviour, where state-dependent energy-allocation and growth strategies are found by optimization. Natural mortality is split into five different components, each specified as the outcome of individual traits and ecological trade-offs: a fixed baseline mortality; size-dependent predation; risk-dependent growth strategy; a fixed mortality when sexually mature; and mortality increasing with reproductive investment. The analysis is repeated with and without fishing. Each component of natural mortality has consequences for optimal life history strategies. Beyond earlier models, we show i) how the two types of reproductive mortality sometimes have similar and sometimes contrasting effects on life history evolution, ii) how ecosystem properties such as food availability and predation levels have stronger effects on optimal strategies than changing other mortality components, and iii) how expected changes in risk-dependent growth strategies are highly variable depending on the type of mortality changed. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

In contrast to the focus on size-selective effects of harvest, here, we test the hypothesis that fishing may select on life-history traits (here, growth rate) via behaviour, even in the absence of size selection. If true, then traditional size-limits used to protect segments of a population cannot fully protect fast growers, because at any given size, fast-growers will be more vulnerable owing to bolder behaviour. We repeatedly measured individual behaviour and growth of 86 crayfish and found that fast-growing individuals were consistently bold and voracious over time, and were subsequently more likely to be harvested in single- and group-trapping trials. In addition, there was some indication that sex had independent effects on behaviour and trappability, whereby females tended to be less active, shyer, slower-growing and less likely to be harvested, but not all these effects were significant. This study represents, to our knowledge, the first across-individual support for this hypothesis, and suggests that behaviour is an important mechanism for fishing selectivity that could potentially lead to evolution of reduced intrinsic growth rates.},

A consequence could be that individuals surviving intensive harvesting, either as a result of behavioural plasticity and/or evolutionary change, exhibit increased average timidity. In the aquatic world, such effects are particularly well documented in passively operated fishing gears common to many commercial and recreational fisheries, such as angling, trapping or gill netting. We thus propose that an exploitation-induced timidity syndrome should be a widespread pattern in fisheries. Importantly, we argue that the syndrome can be associated with several ecological and managerial consequences for social groups, populations, food webs, fisheries and assessment of stocks. We suggest research priorities to deepen our understanding of how exploited fish populations behaviourally respond to harvesting.},

   abstract = {One of the proposed benefits of marine protected areas (MPAs) is to conserve genetic diversity for life-history traits and to restore some semblance of the life history that was expressed before intense exploitation. Strong size-selective mortality from fishing has promoted an earlier age and smaller size at maturity in many species and a concomitant reduction in subsequent adult body sizes. These attributes are less economically desirable than those of fish from less heavily exploited stocks. We attempted to determine whether the establishment of marine protected areas, and the resulting relaxation of the direc-tional selection produced by fishing mortality, would promote a substantial restoration of later ages at maturity. Our quantitative genetic models, calibrated with historical data from Gulf of Mexico popu\ationtof red snapper, Lutjanus campechanus, indicated that adequate variation should remain for life-history traits like age at maturity to respond to new fitness profiles. Marine species with planktonic 1arvac, including most economi-cally important fIShes, have high gene-flow rates that will preclude genetic differentia-tion between the no-take MPAs and the rest of the population. Any changes in the life history that are promoted by the n()-take area may therefore ramify through the entire population. The establishment of no-take MPAs will promote substantial increases in the age at maturity ifrecruitmcnt into them is not limited by density-dependent mortality. If it is, the benefit of n()-take areas for increasing the age at maturity will be decreased. The no-take MPAs must serve as the major source of recruits for nearby fishing areas to produce the proposed benefits. The creation of MPAs will not replace the benefits of limiting age or size biases in harvesting by traditional fisheries management. The global decline in quantity and quality of fishing stocks has created a need for new methods of stock management (Botsford et al., 1997). Marine protected areas (MPAs) and fishing no-take zones are proving to be valuable tools for management of marine fiShery resources (Roberts, 1997; Allison et al., 1998; Lauck et al:, 1998). The proposed virtues of MPAs include protection of spawning stock, elevation of recruitment rates, maintenance of the age and size structures of stocks, and preservation of a balance in the frequencies of predatory and prey species (Ballantine, 1991; Bohnsack, 1992; Gubbay, 1995; Shackell and Willison, 1995; Bohnsack and Ault, 1996). One possible benefit of no-take reserves that has received little attention is the protection of genetic resources for life-history patterns within stocks (Plan Development Team, 1990). This benefit is re-lated to the attempt to conserve stock structure, as indicated by molecular genetic mark-ers (Avise, 1998), but is distinct in referring to the genetic basis of the attributes of indi-vidual fiSh that make them economically desirable and sustain higher population num-bers (Stokes et al., 1993). The most important life-history characters for fishery stocks include the size and age at which individuals mature, the distribution of reproductive effort during life, and age-specific survivorship. Changes in these traits can change the size and age structure of a stock, altering its population dynamics and economic value. For example, a decrease in age at maturity appears to entail maturation at smaller sizes and an overall decrease in the adult body-size distribution (Trippel, 1995). Although earlier maturation can be},

We focus as much as possible on studies conducted under natural or seminatural conditions, as such field studies are most relevant to elucidating the ecological consequences of behavioral variation.

   abstract = {Size-selective harvesting in commercial fisheries can induce rapid changes in biological traits. While experimental and wild harvested populations often exhibit clear shifts in body size and maturation associated with fishing pressure, the relative contributions of genetic and environmental factors to these shifts remain uncertain and have been much debated. To date, observations of so-called fisheries-induced evolution (FIE) have been based solely on phenotypic measures, such as size data. Genetic data are hitherto lacking. Here, we quantify genetic versus environmental change in response to size-selective harvesting for small and large body size in guppies (Poecilia reticulata) across three generations of selection. We document for the first time significant changes at individual genetic loci, some of which have previously been associated with body size. In contrast, variation at neutral microsatellite markers was unaffected by selection, providing direct genetic evidence for rapid evolution induced by size-selective harvesting. These findings demonstrate FIE in an experimental system, with major implications for the sustainability of harvested populations, as well as impacts on size-structured communities and ecosystem processes. These findings highlight the need for scientists and managers to reconsider the capacity of harvested stocks to adapt to, and recover from, harvesting and predation.},

There is a lack of information on the mechanisms and effectiveness of this management system in meeting fisheries and ecosystem sustainability goals.A before-after-control-impact (BACI) pair design, was used to quantify flight initiation distance (FID), and biomass of two fishery-target (Acanthuridae and Scaridae) and one non-target (Chaetodontidae) families in two periodically harvested closures, two no-take marine reserves, and two open fished areas, prior to and after harvest of the periodically harvested closures. Creel surveys were used to quantify catch per unit effort (CPUE) in open fishing grounds, and during the periodic harvests.Before harvest, FID of targeted families was higher in fished areas than periodically harvested areas. After harvest, Acanthuridae FID in periodically harvested closures increased significantly to beyond the maximum effective range of spearguns. Total biomass of fishes was lower in fished areas than areas under either type of management. Acanthuridae biomass in the periodically harvested closures was similar to fished areas, and lower than in the no-take reserves. There was no difference post-harvest for either total or Acanthuridae biomass.CPUE was higher for fishing trips inside the periodically harvested closures than regular fishing activities. Fishes were generally larger in catches from periodically harvested closures, but this was not sufficient to account for the increase in CPUE, particularly of the Acanthuridae, which were significantly more abundant in the harvest catch.When fishes are protected temporarily from fishing, their wariness decreases, which makes them more easily catchable when fishing is reinstated. This study shows that fish behavioural change is an important and overlooked benefit of periodically harvested closures. However, differences in the magnitude of behavioural changes between fishery-target families may result in contrasting outcomes of periodically harvested management regimes.},

Here, we measured the wariness of two families of coral reef fishes in both fished areas and marine reserves embedded within a fished seascape along an exploitation gradient ranging from wilderness sites (Chagos) to heavily fished areas (the Philippines). We used linear mixed effect models to identify relationships between fish flight initiation distance (FID) and fishing pressure, fish size, habitat complexity and life-history stage. Critically, fish FID increased with fishing pressure both in fished areas and inside marine reserves.

Specifically, we examined how fishing pressure was related to pre-flight behavior and flight initiation distance (FID), and whether FID was influenced by body size (centimeters total length), group size (including both con- and hetero-specific individuals), or life-history phase. Fishing pressure was positively associated with higher FID, but only in families that were primarily targeted by spear guns. Among these families, there were variable responses in FID; some families showed increased FID monotonically with fishing pressure, while others showed increased FID only at the highest levels of fishing pressure. Body size was more significant in varying FID at higher levels of fishing pressure. Although family-level differences in pre-flight behavior were reported, such behavior showed low concordance with fishing pressure. FID shows promise as a tool by which compliance and effectiveness of management of reef fisheries can be assessed.},

A total of 539 sharks were collected during the study: 207 in north-west Florida (latitude ~30°N), 176 in Tampa Bay (~28°N) and 156 in Florida Bay (~25°N). Male and female bonnetheads in north-west Florida had the largest predicted asymptotic sizes (1007 mm and 1398 mm TL, respectively) and attained the largest estimated median size at maturity (830 mm and 944 mm, respectively) and the oldest estimated median age at maturity (3.0+ years and 4.0+ years, respectively). The largest near-term embryos (297 mm TL) were also collected at the highest latitude, but no latitudinal difference in litter size was found. These differences in life-history traits provide supporting evidence that a pattern of latitudinal variation exists. Male and female bonnetheads in north-west Florida also had the fastest growth rate compared with the other locations, supporting the hypothesis that growth rate is inversely related to the length of the growing season (i.e. a pattern of countergradient variation exists).},

   abstract = {Understanding the factors that influence the distribution and abundance of predators, including sharks, is important for predicting the impacts of human changes to the environment. Such studies are particularly important in Florida Bay, USA where there are planned large-scale changes to patterns of freshwater input from the Everglades ecosystem. Studies of many marine predators suggest that links between predator and prey habitat use may vary with spatial scale, but there have been few studies of the role of prey distribution in shaping habitat use and abundance of sharks. We used longline catches of sharks and trawls for potential teleost prey to determine the influence of teleost abundance on shark abundance at the scale of regions and habitats in Florida Bay. We found that shark catch per unit effort (CPUE) was not linked to CPUE ofteleosts at the scale of sampling sites, but shark CPUE was positively correlated with the mean CPUE for teleosts within a region. Although there does not appear to be a strong match between the abundance of teleosts and sharks at small spatial scales, regional shark abundance is likely driven, at least partially, by the availability of prey. Management strategies that influence teleost abundance will have cascading effects to higher trophic levels in Florida Bay. © Springer 2006.},

   abstract = {Seasonal changes in freshwater inflow and other environmental conditions may induce changes in density and species composition of mangrove fishes along estuarine gradients. Fishes within mangrove habitats in a subtropical estuary were sampled monthly from May 1989 to May 1990, using block nets with rotenone and visual censuses. At 18 stations, temperature ranged from 22 to 34 C, depth from 10 to 104 cm and underwater visibility from 1 to 13 m. Salinity ranged from 0 to 60 upstream, and 35 to 54 mid-and downstream. A total of 573 191 individuals (76 species) was observed or collected, with an average density of 6·5 fish m 2 . Engraulidae, Atherinidae, Poeciliidae and Cyprinodontidae numerically dominated the assemblage. Distinct assemblages occurred up-, mid-and downstream and maintained coherent groups in these gradient positions over the seasons. Residents totalled 94·5% of the individuals, estuarine transients comprised 5·1% and occasional marine visitors were less than 0·4%. Densities of resident fishes peaked in winter as temperatures and water levels fell, uncorrelated with changes in salinity. These observations suggest that mangrove habitats may sustain diverse and abundant fish communities dominated by euryhaline residents. Although estuarine transients were consistently rare in upstream sub-basins, downstream were found numerous sub-adults of species occurring as adults on nearby reefs (Lutjanidae, Haemulidae). Thus, reef-associated estuarine transients may be abundant in mangrove habitats having near-marine salinities. Contrary to expectations, mangrove habitats in northeast-ern Florida bay did not function as a nursery as defined under the nursery-ground paradigm: young-of-the-year juveniles of estuarine transient species did not seek low salinity sub-basins. However, northeastern Florida Bay may not be representative of most mangrove estuaries as the area: (1) is without lunar tides and related circulation; (2) has low and variable amounts of submersed vegetation; and (3) experiences severe hypersaline conditions.},

This article examines the division of interagency responsibilities and demonstrates the depth of this federal-state partnership. The coordination between federal, state, and local institutions is a product of many factors, including an explicit legislative mandate, inclusion of both federal and state waters in the sanctuary, two decades of successful federal-state partnerships in two small national marine sanctuaries in the Florida Keys, the state of Florida's longtime interest in management of its marine resources, and the clear acceptance of principles of ecosystem management by both federal and state natural resource agencies. Obstacles include funding uncertainties, the vagaries of local politics, and the enormity of the proposed tasks.

This technique, which uses the δ18O and δD of the water, allows for differentiation of the freshwater derived from precipitation as opposed to runoff, because surface waters in the Everglades have been highly evaporated and therefore have elevated δ18O and δD values relative to precipitation. A time series of monthly δ18O and δD values of surface waters, collected from stations in Florida Bay between 1993 and 1999, has shown that, during this time, the major source of freshwaters causing depressions in the salinity in the western portion of Florida Bay was derived from precipitation rather than from the runoff of water from the Everglades. In the eastern portion of Florida Bay, close to the boundary between peninsular Florida and the Bay, the proportion of freshwater derived from precipitation drops steadily, reaching <10%. This method not only allows differentiation between the sources of freshwater but can, in a temporal sense, ascertain the effectiveness of water management practices on the salinity of the estuarine ecosystems of South Florida.},

Recent ecological changes (seagrass die-off, algal blooms, increased turbidity) to the Florida Bay ecosystem have focused the attention of the public, commercial interests, scientists, and resource managers on the factors influencing the structure and function of Florida Bay. Restoring Florida Bay to some historic condition is the goal of resource managers, but what is not clear is what an anthropogenically-unaltered Florida Bay would look like. While there is general consensus that human activities have contributed to the changes occurring in the Florida Bay ecosystem, a high degree of natural system variability has made elucidation of the links between human activity and Florida Bay dynamics difficult. Paleoecological analyses, examination of long-term datasets, and directed measurements of aspects of the ecology of Florida Bay all contribute to our understanding of the behavior of the bay, and allow quantification of the magnitude of the recent ecological changes with respect to historical variability of the system.},

Management protocol for one such canal network (C-111) is being modified in part to try to improve habitat for estuarine fish and wading birds in northeastern Florida Bay, an estuarine part of Everglades National Park. Changes in canal management could alter the spatial and temporal salinity regime in the estuary. To better predict the effect of such changes on estuarine habitat, abundances of submersed vegetation and benthic animals were sampled repeatedly at 12 stations that differed in salinity. A variety of other parameters were also measured (nutrients, light, temperature, oxygen, sediment characteristics, and others). Mean salinity among stations ranged from 11.4 parts per thousand to 33.1 parts per thousand. Densities of benthic plants and animals differed among stations by several orders of magnitude. The standard deviation of salinity was the best environmental correlate with mean plant biomass and benthic animal density: less biota occurred at stations with greater fluctuations in salinity. The two stations with the least plant biomass also had the highest mean water temperatures. In a stepwise multiple regression analysis, standard deviation of salinity accounted for 59% of the variation in the logarithm of mean plant biomass among stations. For every 3 parts per thousand increase in the standard deviation, total benthic plant biomass decreased by an order of magnitude. Mean water temperature accounted for only 14% of the variation, and mean salinity was not included for lack of significance. At stations with widely fluctuating salinities, not only was biomass low, but species dominance also frequently changed. Severe fluctuation in salinity may have prevented abundant benthos by causing physiological stress that reduced growth and survival. Salinity may not have remained within the range of tolerance of any one plant species for long enough to allow the development of a substantially vegetated benthic community. Hence, gaining control over salinity fluctuation may be the key to estuarine habitat improvement through canal management in southern Florida.},

Locally, the P content of leaves decreased from a high of 0.16% P (wt/wt) 30 m from the nutrient source to a low of 0.08% 120m from the source; the C and N content (34.9 and 2.1%) was independent of distance from the nutrient source. Due to variations in P content, C:P and N:P, but not C:N, varied locally. Regionally, P content varied greatly, from 0.05 to 0.20%; C(29.4-39.5%) and N(1.7-2.7%) showed considerably less variation. Variation in C:P and N:P across the bay encompassed a range nearly as great as reported for all seagrasses around the world combined; C:N showed little variation. Local variation around the nutrient point source indicated that C:P and N:P were indicators of P availability, and trend analysis of the regional spatial variation in C:P and N:P showed that availability was greatest in northwest, and least in eastern, Florida Bay. This pattern mirrored abundance of seagrasses and productivity in the bay. T. testudinum from the bay appears to be P limited and N saturated, even in the sparsest seagrass communities.},

   abstract = {Biscayne Bay is a shallow subtropical lagoon on Floridas southeastern coast that is bordered to the west by the mainland and to the east by barrier islands and keys. Fish assemblages inhabiting two types of mangrove-lined shoreline that encompass the Bay were examined using a visual belt-transect census method over four consecutive sea- sons. Several significant differences were evident between shoreline habitats in terms of fish species composition, taxonomic richness and taxon-specific densities; seasonal changes and fish size-structure differences were few. The mangrove shorelines along the mainland (ML) consistently harbored less fish taxa than those on the leeward side of the islands and keys (LK), but harbored higher densities of several euryhaline forms (i.e., killifishes and livebearers). Densities of fishes that are typically associated with coral reef habitats (i.e., snappers and grunts) tended to be higher within LK vs ML mangrove shorelines, but there were exceptions (e.g., great barracuda, Sphyraena barracuda). For five fish species, length-frequency distributions were compared between the Bays man- grove shorelines and nearby coral reef habitats. These data comparisons lent partial sup- port to an ontogenetic mangrove-to-reef migration model for only two of the five spe- cies examined. Results suggest that these shoreline habitats play varying ontogenetic and trophic roles, depending on location, season and fish species. Biscayne Bays mangrove shoreline fish assemblages appear to reflect: (1) proximity of the mangroves that they occupy to offshore reef habitats; (2) salinity regime along the shoreline; and (3) water depths within the mangrove forest interior. The fish assemblage information collected here may serve as a baseline in future assessments of fishing impacts or the effects of other anthropogenic changes to Biscayne Bay and its watershed.},

   abstract = {We examine evidence for the structuring of fish communities from stream and lake systems and the roles of biotic, abiotic, and spatial factors in determining the species composition. Piscivory by fish is a dominant factor in both stream and lake systems whereas evidence for the importance of competition appears less convincing. Within small streams or lakes, the impact of predation may exclude other species, thereby leading to mutually exclusive distributions and strong differences in community composition. Within a geographic region, abiotic effects frequently dictate the rel-ative importance of piscivory, thereby indirectly influencing the composition of prey species present. The spatial scale of studies influences our perceived importance of biotic versus abiotic factors, with small-scale studies indicating a greater importance of competition and large-scale studies emphasizing abiotic controls. The scale of the individual sites considered is critical because smaller systems have higher variability and wider extremes of conditions than larger lakes and rivers. The stability of physical systems and degree of spatial connectivity contribute to increased diversity in both larger stream and larger lake systems. We identify challenges and needs that must be addressed both to advance the field of fish community ecology and to face the problems associated with human-induced changes. Résumé : Nous avons étudié la structuration des communautés de poissons dans les cours d'eau et les lacs, ainsi que le rôle des facteurs abiotiques, biotiques et spatiaux dans la détermination de la composition spécifique. La piscivorie par les poissons s'avère être un facteur dominant, tant dans les cours d'eau que dans les lacs; en revanche, le rôle de la compétition est établi de façon moins convaincante. Dans les petits cours d'eau et lacs, la prédation peut exclure des espèces, ce qui résulte en des répartitions mutuellement exclusives et de fortes différences dans la composition des communautés. Dans une même région géographique, les facteurs abiotiques contrôlent souvent l'importance relative de la piscivorie, influençant ainsi la composition spécifique des proies présentes. L'échelle spatiale à laquelle les études sont conduites affecte la perception que l'on peut avoir de l'importance relative des facteurs biotiques par rapport aux facteurs abiotiques; les études à petite échelle révèlent une plus grande importance de la compétition, alors que celles à grande échelle mettent de l'avant les facteurs de contrôle abiotiques. L'échelle spatiale des sites individuels choisis re-vêt une importance critique, parce que les systèmes plus petits sont plus variables et présentent un plus grand éventail de conditions extrêmes que les grands lacs et les rivières. La stabilité des systèmes physiques et le degré de connecti-vité spatiale entraînent un accroissement de la diversité, tant dans les rivières que les lacs de grande taille. Nous identi-fions, en terminant, des défis à rencontrer et des besoins à combler pour faire progresser l'écologie des communautés de poissons et pour pouvoir faire face aux problèmes causés par les changements anthropiques.

Water temperature, salinity, dissolved oxygen and depth measurements were recorded during fish sampling and bottom vegetation was also quantified. The survey yielded a total of 38 134 individuals from 95 taxa. Fish species composition was similar among sites, but more species were collected from stable- versus variable-salinity areas Mean fish abundance dnd the mean abundances of Euc~nostonius gula. Lagodon rhornboides, Opsanus beta and Lutjanus griseus shared a general pattern of increase from north to so~.~th, with highest values occurring at one or more of the canal-influenced sites In contrast, mean specles nchness and the mean abundances of Lucanlaparva, Haenlirlon sciurw, H. plurnleri, and H. parra were signif~cantly greater at stable-salinity sltes than at variable-salinity sites Freshwdter challenge experiments \yere then condu.ctcd on each of the fishes above, as well as on 2 relatively uncommon species, Cynoscion nebulosus and Cypnnodon vadegatus. The mortality of groups exposed to a single, rapid, freshwater pulse (i.e. salinity was changed from approximately 32 ppt to 0 to 32 ppt over 2 h) was compared with that of controls. Of the 8 fishes that dominated the nearshore habitats of Biscaync Bay, 5 exhibited no mortality and L. rhornboldrs, L. parva, and H. plurnleri exhibited 12.5, 50 and loo'% mortality rates, respectively. Mortality was 10Oo0 for the relatively uncommon C. nebulos~ls and C. variegatus. Results suggest that the differential osmoregulatory abilities of the species tested may underlie some, but not all, of the structural differences observed between fish assemblages from stable-sa1i:nity habitats versus those ddjacent to freshwater canals.},

Methods: Commercial D-dimer assays, evaluated according to predetermined cutoff levels for each assay, specific for age (lower in subjects <70 years) and gender (lower in males), were used in the recent DULCIS study. The present analysis compared the results obtained in the DULCIS with those that might have been had using the following different cutoff criteria: traditional cutoff for VTE exclusion, higher levels in subjects aged ≥60 years, or age multiplied by 10. Results: In young subjects, the DULCIS low cutoff levels resulted in half the recurrent events that would have occurred using the other criteria. In elderly patients, the DULCIS results were similar to those calculated for the two age-adjusted criteria. The adoption of traditional VTE exclusion criteria would have led to positive results in the large majority of elderly subjects, without a significant reduction in the rate of recurrent event. Conclusion: The results confirm the usefulness of the cutoff levels used in DULCIS.},

In contrast to findings of other studies conducted on small juveniles and forage fishes in the IRL, this study suggested that distributions of the more mobile organisms are influenced more by physical conditions than by biological interactions. Consequently, environmentally-corrected single species models will be more effective in assessing changes in stock abundance and habitat preferences of mobile species in the IRL. Because of the fluctuations in physical conditions in the IRL and other estuaries, it may be inappropriate to use biologically based methods that rely solely on species interactions to assess fish stocks in those systems.},

   abstract = {Marine reserves are a promising tool for fisheries management and conservation of biodiversity, but they are not a panacea for fisheries management problems. For fisheries that target highly mobile single species with little or no by-catch or habitat impact, marine reserves provide few benefits compared to conventional fishery management tools. For fisheries that are multi-species or on more sedentary stocks, or for which broader ecological impacts of fishing are an issue, marine reserves have some potential advantages. Their successful use requires a case-by-case understanding of the spatial structure of impacted fisheries, ecosystems and human communities. Marine reserves, together with other fishery management tools, can help achieve broad fishery and biodiversity objectives, but their use will require careful planning and evaluation. Mistakes will be made, and without planning, monitoring and evaluation, we will not learn what worked, what did not, and why. If marine reserves are implemented without case by case evaluation and appropriate monitoring programs, there is a risk of unfulfilled expectations, the creation of disincentives, and a loss of credibility of what potentially is a valuable management tool. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

However, quantifying inbreeding depression in wild populations is challenging, requiring large sample sizes, detailed knowledge of life histories and study over many generations. Here we report analyses of the effects of close inbreeding, based on observations of mating between relatives, in a large, free-living noninsular great tit (Parus major) population monitored over 41 years. Although mating between close relatives (f > or = 0.125) was rare (1.0-2.6% of matings, depending on data set restrictiveness), we found pronounced inbreeding depression, which translated into reduced hatching success, fledging success, recruitment to the breeding population and production of grand offspring. An inbred mating at f = 0.25 had a 39% reduction in fitness relative to that of an outbred nest, when calculated in terms of recruitment success, and a 55% reduction in the number of fledged grand offspring. Our data show that inbreeding depression acts independently at each life-history stage in this population, and hence suggest that estimates of the fitness costs of inbreeding must focus on the entire life cycle.},

   abstract = {Benefits for fisheries from marine protected areas (MPAs) are expected from recruitment of exported eggs and larvae as well as from spillover of adults to adjacent fishing grounds. Because the recruitment effect is difficult to detect, spillover is presently the only tangible potential fishery benefit of MPAs. Despite abundant evidence of spillover in the literature, this is the first study to quantify the number and biomass of individuals annually spilling over from an MPA and their contribution to the local fishery catches. Using a decade (1997-2007) of tag-recapture data for the lobster Palinurus elephas from the Columbretes Islands Marine Reserve (CIMR), we estimated annual emigration probabilities of 3.7% (female) and 6.7% (male), and quantified the resulting spillover to adjacent fished areas. We showed that during an 8 to 17 yr protection period, harvested spillover offset the loss of yield resulting from the reduction of fishing grounds set aside in the CIMR, producing a mean annual net benefit of 10% of the catch in weight. Although the number of lobsters spilling over annually did not quite make up for the loss of fishing grounds in the CIMR, it did in weight because the mean size of the lobsters emigrating from the reserve was larger than that of those outside. We propose that nomadic or home range movements of individuals near MPA boundaries, seasonal migrations and migrations forced by extraordinary meteorological events, and density-dependent movements facilitated spillover from the CIMR. Fishing effort concentration along its boundaries and high exploitation rates in the local fishery limited the spatial extent of spillover.},

   abstract = {ABSTRACT: The issue of conservation and sustainable use of high seas resources is increasingly becoming significant, as is reflected in the number of planned international activities in ocean science and management, e.g. the United Nations General Assembly Working Group on marine bio-diversity beyond national jurisdiction. Essentially, the increasing exploitation pressure on high and deep sea resources makes discussion of viable policy options for international waters an important topic. To our knowledge, this paper provides the first global, economically supported assessment of the impact on fisheries of potentially protecting a portion of the high seas in no-take marine protected areas. Such closures are likely to result in relatively little global annual profit loss. For example, closure of 20% of the high seas may lead to the loss of only 1.8% of the current global reported marine fisheries catch, and a decrease in profits to the high seas fleet of about US$270 million per year. Thus, at globally minimal costs, the international community could benefit substantially by securing insurance against extinctions and the loss of the spectacular marine diversity in the high and deep seas, while protecting many market and non-market values for the benefit of both current and future generations.},

   abstract = {Whether inbreeding affects the demography and persistence of natural populations has been questioned. However, new pedigree data from field populations and molecular and analytical tools for tracing patterns of relationship and inbreeding have now enhanced our ability to detect inbreeding depression within and among wild populations. This work reveals that levels of inbreeding depression vary across taxa, populations and environments, but are usually substantial enough to affect both individual and population performance. Data from bird and mammal populations suggest that inbreeding depression often significantly affects birth weight, survival, reproduction and resistance to disease, predation and environmental stress. Plant studies, based mostly on comparing populations that differ in size or levels of genetic variation, also reveal significant inbreeding effects on seed set, germination, survival and resistance to stress. Data from butterflies, birds and plants demonstrate that populations with reduced genetic diversity often experience reduced growth and increased extinction rates. Crosses between such populations often result in heterosis. Such a genetic rescue effect might reflect the masking of fixed deleterious mutations. Thus, it might be necessary to retain gene flow among increasingly fragmented habitat patches to sustain populations that are sensitive to inbreeding.},

The number of monocytes and neutrophils also initially increased at 1 d postinfection. This confirms the importance of these types of cells in initial inflammation and mycobacterial infection in striped bass. The phagocytic index of splenic leukocytes over these same time frames did not change significantly following infection.

   abstract = {Mycobacteriosis, a chronic bacterial disease of fishes, is prevalent in adult striped bass from Chesapeake Bay (USA). Although environmental factors may play a role in disease expression, the interaction between the disease and environmental stress remains unexplored. We therefore examined the individual and interactive effects of elevated temperature, hypoxia, and mycobacteriosis on the metabolism of wild-caught adult striped bass from Chesapeake Bay using respirometry. Because the spleen is the primary target organ of mycobacteriosis in striped bass, we hypothesized that the disease interferes with the ability of fish to increase their hematocrit in the face of increasing oxygen demands. We determined standard metabolic rate (SMR), maximum metabolic rate under normoxia (MMRN), critical oxygen saturation (S(crit)), and MMR under hypoxia (3 mg O(2) l-1: MMR(H)) for healthy and visibly diseased fish (i.e. exhibiting skin lesions indicative of mycobacteriosis). Measurements were taken at a temperature within the preferred thermal range (20°C) and at an elevated temperature (28°C) considered stressful to striped bass. In addition, we calculated aerobic scope (AS(N) = MMR(N) - SMR, AS(H) = MMR(H) - SMR) and factorial scope (FS(N) = MMR(N) SMR-1, FS(H) = MMR(H) SMR-1). SMR increased with increasing temperature, and hypoxia reduced MMR, AS, and FS. Mycobacteriosis alone did not affect either MMR(N) or MMR(H). However, elevated temperature affected the ability of diseased striped bass to tolerate hypoxia (S(crit)). Overall, our data indicate that striped bass performance under hypoxia is impaired, and that elevated water temperatures, hypoxia, and severe mycobacteriosis together reduce aerobic scope more than any of these stressors acting alone. We conclude that the scope for activity of diseased striped bass in warm hypoxic waters is significantly compromised.},

Historically, fisheries for blue crabs, American shad, striped bass, and Atlantic sturgeon thrived in the Chesapeake Bay region but in recent times, and with the exception of striped bass, these fisheries have declined. Fishes of the York River exhibit divergent life history patterns, from fast growing, highly fecund species such as alewife, to slow growing, late-maturing species with low fecundity such as Atlantic sturgeon.

   abstract = {For organisms with great fecundity and high mortality in early life stages, such as shellfish or fishes, the need to match reproductive activity with environmental conditions conducive to spawning, fertilization, larval development and recruitment may result in extreme variance in reproductive success among individuals. The main objective of this study was to investigate evidence of large variance in the reproductive success of the striped bass Morone saxatilis in the Santee-Cooper system, South Carolina, USA. Seven microsatellite loci were analysed in 603 recruits representing three yearly cohorts from 1992 to 1994, and a group analysis was performed to identify full-sib families. Large variance in reproductive success was detected, with a few large, full-sib families contributing disproportionately to each of the cohorts. The severity of sweepstakes reproductive success varied among cohorts depending on environmentally imposed mortality. Estimations of the effective number of breeders in these long-lived fish ranged from 24 in 1992 to 44 in 1994. Furthermore, the estimated genetic effective population size (N(e) = 93) is approximately four orders of magnitude lower than estimates of adult census size (N = 362 000). Furthermore, the presence of large full-sib families indicates that striped bass engage in pair mating in the wild. Heterogeneity in genetic composition was also observed among cohorts, suggesting that genetically different adults contribute to different cohorts and that chance rather than fitness variation determines reproductive success.},

   abstract = {Most assessments of fish stocks use some measure of the reproductive potential of a population, such as spawning biomass. However, the correlation between spawning biomass and reproductive potential is not always strong, and it likely is weakest in the tropics and subtropics, where species tend to exhibit indeterminate fecundity and release eggs in batches over a protracted spawning season. In such cases, computing annual reproductive output requires estimates of batch fecundity and the annual number of batches the latter subject to spawning frequency and duration of spawning season. Batch fecundity is commonly measured by age (or size), but these other variables are not. Without the relevant data, the annual number of batches is assumed to be invariant across age. We reviewed the literature and found that this default assumption lacks empirical support because both spawning duration and spawning frequency generally increase with age or size. We demonstrate effects of this assumption on measures of reproductive value and spawning potential ratio, a metric commonly used to gauge stock status. Model applications showed substantial sensitivity to age dependence in the annual number of batches. If the annual number of batches increases with age but is incorrectly assumed to be constant, stock assessment models would tend to overestimate the biological reference points used for setting harvest rates. This study underscores the need to better understand the age- or size-dependent contrast in the annual number of batches, and we conclude that, for species without evidence to support invariance, the default assumption should be replaced with one that accounts for age- or size-dependence.},

In most years concurrent sampling along the coast was conducted over spring and summer months to resolve the initiation of spawning. We examined the spawning location, pattern and timing, and calculated the fecundity of fish from 600 to 840 mm in length. Based on macro- and microscopic analysis of female gonads, bluefish are multiple spawners with indeterminate fecundity. The presence of all stages of development in fully mature ovaries further indicates that bluefish have asynchronous oocyte development. Mean age at first maturity for female bluefish was ???1.90 years and 480 mm total length. Mean batch fecundity was 402,247 eggs and ranged from 114,513 to 920,746 eggs, depending on age and weight. Direct observation of gonads showed imminent spawning in Florida and North Carolina during March to April, and from April to August from Virginia to New York. Given the progression of oocyte development over the range of space and time we sampled, we suggest that bluefish exhibit continuous spawning during their migration from the South Atlantic Bight (SAB) to Middle Atlantic Bight (MAB). ?? 2007 Elsevier B.V.

   abstract = {Puberty is the period during which full sexual development occurs and the capacity to reproduce is acquired. Despite its importance, our understanding of the endocrine regulation of puberty in lower vertebrates is still limited. The objective of the present study was to describe the changes in gonadal development and plasma steroid levels in a relatively late maturing species,the striped bass, during the first four years of life. In about 65% of the females, puberty was initiated during the third year. Although gonadosomatic index (GSI) and oocyte diameter increased during this year, this first cycle was characterized by a heterogeneous population of developing oocytes, a relatively low mean maximum oocyte diameter, and an absence of yolk granules in the oocytes. Plasma 17 beta-estradiol (E- 2) levels were low in all three-year-old fish, suggesting that an insufficient stimulation of vitellogenin production by E-2 may underlie the lack of vitellogenin incorporation into developing oocytes. All monitored parameters increased during the fourth year, but were still below the values attained by older females. In about 60% of the males, puberty was initiated during the first year and all males were mature by the third year. During the first two years, several immature males initiated spermatogenesis without reaching full maturity. In mature males, mean GSI, plasma testosterone, and 11-ketotestosterone levels increased simultaneously, reaching higher values each subsequent year. Our results indicate that, similar to the situation in mammals, more than one reproductive cycle is required in striped bass before complete adulthood is reached. J. Exp. Zool. 286:49-63, 2000.

   abstract = {Younger ages and smaller sizes at maturation have been observed in commercial fish stocks over the last century. We establish that age and length at 50% proportion mature (i.e. the proportion of mature individuals in a population or the probability that an individual is mature) decreased from the 1970s to the 2000s in North Sea cod <i>Gadus morhua</i>, haddock <i>Melanogrammus aeglefinus</i> and whiting <i>Merlangius merlangus</i>, but not in Norway pout <i>Trisopterus esmarkii</i>. The potential contributions of demography, phenotypic plasticity and evolution to these trends were assessed. First, maturation trends were extricated from demographic effects and growth-dependent plasticity by estimating probabilistic maturation reaction norms (PMRNs). PMRN midpoints have significantly shifted downwards at most ages for cod, haddock and whiting, but not for Norway pout. Second, increased temperature and food abundance, loosened trophic competition and relaxed social pressure may also trigger growth-independent plasticity in maturation. Principal component regression of PMRN midpoints on annual estimates of relevant environmental variables exhibiting a temporal trend suggest that, despite some evidence of environmental effects, PMRN trends were mostly independent of growth-independent plasticity in haddock, whiting and male cod, but not in female cod. According to these findings, evolution of maturation, potentially in response to fishing, is plausible in haddock, whiting and male cod, but unlikely for Norway pout, and does not explain trends in female cod maturation. In agreement with life-history theory, the maturation response was larger in fast-growing, late- and large-maturing species exhibiting moderate reproductive effort.},

Accordingly, changes in seagrass coverage may affect fish communities and/or populations, given that many species utilize these habitats during vulnerable early life history stages. In lower Chesapeake Bay, seagrass distribution has contracted appreciably over recent decades due to decreased water clarity and increased water temperature; however, effects of changing vegetated habitat on fish community structure have not been well documented. We compared fish community composition data collected at similar seagrass sites from 1976-1977 and 2009-2011 to investigate potential changes in species richness, community composition, and relative abundance within these habitats. While seagrass coverage at the specific study sites did not vary considerably between time periods, contemporary species richness was lower and multivariate analysis showed that assemblages differed between the two datasets. The majority of sampled species were common to both datasets but several species were exclusive to only one dataset. For some species, relative abundances were similar between the two datasets, while for others, there were notable differences without directional uniformity. Spot (Leiostomus xanthurus) and northern pipefish (Syngnathus fuscus) were considerably less abundant in the contemporary dataset, while dusky pipefish (Syngnathus floridae) was more abundant. Observed changes in community structure may be more attributable to higher overall bay water temperature in recent years and other anthropogenic influences than to changes in seagrass coverage at our study sites.},

   abstract = {The Big Old Fat Fecund Female Fish (BOFFFF) hypothesis is explored quantitatively using an age-structured stock production model in which the usual stock:recruit rela- tionship is replaced by a three-stage recruitment process based on maternal age. The recruitment process is decomposed into three age-dependent stages: 1) number of eggs spawned per batch per female, 2) number of batches spawned per year (related to the length of the spawning season), 3) increased survival of young stages with maternal age. The first two stages together give the stock recruitment potential and can be well justified by experimental observation in many fish species. The third stage is affected by both maternal age and also environmental conditions. The results indi- cate that the number of batches spawned per year is the most important component. They also indicate that a few old fish potentially contribute many times more recruits to the population than many younger fish. It is argued that the concept of spawner stock biomass (which is heavily weighted by the large numbers of young first time spawners, especially in heavily exploited populations) should be replaced by the con- cept of stock recruitment potential, which takes the age-structure of the population in to account. The conclusion is that for many long-lived fish populations such as hake and cod, management should aim to maintain the age-structure of the population, rather than encouraging, or even targeting, exploitation of large, old fish.},

At the height of the outbreak infection rates and mortality rates were about 0.4 year1 and 1.5 year1, respectively. Parameterization of infection rate as a year-class and age effect was more complex and did not provide a better fit than a year and age parameterization. The impact of I. hoferi on the North Sea herring stock was estimated to be significant but not catastrophic. Had the outbreak not occurred (but with catches being the same), the stock size would have been some 21% higher in 1994. Had the outbreak not occurred (but with fishing mortality being the same), the stock would have been 11% higher in 1994 and the catches from 1991 to 1994 would have been 9.6% higher. The consequences of using a standard stock assessment model in which nonfishing mortality is assumed constant when this assumption is violated are also assessed.

   abstract = {Macroscopic or visual staging is the primary method for determining maturity status of walleye pollock Theragra chalcogramma stocks in the Gulf of Alaska and the Bering Sea, although its accuracy has not been estab- lished. To address this, maturity data and samples were taken during several annual spawning surveys of pollock conducted in Shelikof Strait, Gulf of Alaska. Comparison of histological and macroscopic staging methods on 126 ovary samples resulted in a 25% misclassification rate, with 75% of these misclassifications reclassified into the adjacent stages. Misclassifications were most common among developing stages 2 and 3, and the prespawning stage 4. Paired readings of female pollock maturities were made at sea during the surveys, with readers disagreeing on classification stage in 36% of 411 observations. Reader disagreements were most common between stages 3 and 4 (11.4%), stages 4 and 5 (5.8%) and stages 7 and 8 (4.8%). Errors made across the boundaries of stages 3 and 4 as well as stages 2 and 8 can impact the estimates of length at 50% maturity and consequently the spawning stock biomass. These types of errors were observed in the histological validation process, but due to the very low incidence of stages 3 and 8 in the survey population (1.8% and 0.4%, respectively), the contribution of these potential errors to maturity assessments can be considered small.},

   abstract = {Larval production as a function of female size and hatchery propagation methods was examined for a South Carolina striped bass (Morone saxatilis ) hatchery from 1988 to 1990. Female weight was not related to egg size or embryo survival among years or between source rivers of females. However, female weight was strongly related to number of hatched embryos due to its collinearity with fecundity. In 1988 and 1990, the offspring of 14 females contributed to 50% of hatchery production. In 1989, only six females contributed to 50% of larval production. In 1990, changes in propagation methods associated with improved female response to hormone injection resulted in more consistent rates of larval production among broods. While the deleterious effects of inbreeding on striped bass populations remain unknown, results indicate that extensive use of large females by hatcheries in fishery recovery programs could decrease effective population size},

   abstract = {Over the past few decades, ultrasonography has been used intermittently as a non-invasive, diagnostic tool for evaluating a variety of conditions in aquatic organisms. There has been a recent upsurge in scientific articles in which ultrasound images were used as a diagnostic tool, and the predominant use was to evaluate gender and other reproductive issues. Ultrasonography equipment is available in a variety of configurations, but we are unaware of any published literature that evaluates the efficacy of the various probe types for diverse uses (e.g., anatomical and physiological examinations). In this paper, we compare striped bass ovary volume and fecundity data based on ultrasonic images produced by probes with different frequencies and array types and offer considerations for determining which frequency or array type best facilitates various potential applications. Both the 3.5/5.0 MHz and the 6.0/8.0 MHz probes were equally effective in determining striped bass sex, but not for determining ovary volume. The 3.5/5.0 MHz curved array probe offered the best resolution of female striped bass ovaries. However, ovary area measurements had to be performed in the field because the curved images were incompatible with the image analysis software used in the lab. The 6.0/8.0 MHz linear array probe provided only partial images of ovaries in striped bass > 850 mm, and estimates of ovary area were based on several scanned and recorded images. However, the 6.0/8.0 MHz linear array probe has the advantage of a field scan, which can be recorded and later calibrated to computer image analysis software in the lab. Careful consideration of the type of animal and parts of its anatomy to be imaged as well as the image acquisition and processing circumstances should be undertaken to ensure that the ultrasonic imaging technology used is appropriate to the task. ?? 2005 Elsevier B.V.

Mortality was modelled as a power function of weight, and the parameters b (exponent) and M(u) (mortality at the unit weight of 1 g) estimated for fish in the six ecosystems, as well as within selected populations, species and families. At the ecosystem level, no significant differences in parameters were found between lakes, rivers and the ocean and a joint mortality-weight relationship for all natural ecosystems was estimated with parameters b = -0.288 (90% CL[ -0.315, - 0.261]) and M(u) = 3.00 (90% CL[2.70, 3.30]) year(-1). Among the culture systems, mortality-weight relationships in ponds and cages were not significantly different and a joint relationship was estimated. The weight exponents of mortality in ponds/cages and tanks were very similar at about b = -0.43, and significantly more negative than in natural ecosystems. Mortalities at unit weight were significantly lower in tanks (0.91 year(-1)) than in ponds/cages (2.24 year(-1)), and both were significantly lower than in natural ecosystems. No systematic differences were found between the mortality-weight relationships determined for individual populations, species or families, and fish in the respective ecosystems. It is hypothesized that aquaculture mortality-weight relationships indicate the allometric scaling of non-predation mortality, which is therefore more strongly size dependent than predation mortality. If non-predation mortality in natural ecosystems shows a similar scaling with body weight, then the allometric exponent of predation mortality must be less negative than that observed for total natural mortality. Implications of the established mortality-weight relationships for aquaculture and culture-based fisheries are discussed. (C) 1996 The Fisheries Society of the British Isles [References: 129]},

Growth characteristics, acid-fastness and 16S rRNA gene sequencing results were consistent with those of the genus Mycobacterium. Biochemical reactions, growth characteristics and mycolic acid profiles (HPLC) resembled those of Mycobacterium shottsii, a non-pigmented mycobacterium also isolated during the same epizootic. Sequencing of the 16S rRNA genes, the gene encoding the exported repeated protein (erp) and the gene encoding the 65 kDa heat-shock protein (hsp65) and restriction enzyme analysis of the hsp65 gene demonstrated that this group of isolates is unique. Insertion sequences associated with Mycobacterium ulcerans, IS2404 and IS2606, were detected by PCR. These isolates could be differentiated from other slowly growing pigmented mycobacteria by their inability to grow at 37 degrees C, production of niacin and urease, absence of nitrate reductase, negative Tween 80 hydrolysis and resistance to isoniazid (1 mug ml(-1)), p-nitrobenzoic acid, thiacetazone and thiophene-2-carboxylic hydrazide. On the basis of this polyphasic study, it is proposed that these isolates represent a novel species, Mycobacterium pseudoshottsii sp. nov.

   abstract = {By definition, a population is regulated if it persists for many generations with fluctuations bounded above zero with high probability. Regulation thus requires density-dependent negative feedback whereby the population has a propensity to increase when small and decrease when large. Ultimately, extinction occurs due to regulating mechanisms becoming weaker than various disruptive events and stochastic variation. Population regulation is one of the foundational concepts of ecology, yet this paradigm has often been challenged, during the first half of the 20th century when the concept was not clearly defined, and more recently by some who study demographically open populations. The history of ecology reveals that earlier manifestations of the concept focused mostly on competition as the mechanism of population regulation. Because competition is often not evident in nature, it was sometimes concluded that population regulation was therefore also absent. However, predation in the broadest sense can also cause density dependence. By the 1950s, the idea that demographic density dependence was essential (but not sufficient) for population regulation was well established, and since then, challenges to the general concept have been short lived. However, some now believe that metapopulations composed of demographically open local populations can persist without density dependence. In particular, some recent manifestations of the Recruitment Limitation Hypothesis all but preclude the possibility of regulation. The theory of locally open populations indicates that persistence always relies on direct demographic density dependence at some spatial and temporal scale, even in models reportedly demonstrating the contrary. There is also increasing empirical evidence, especially in marine systems where competition for space is not self evident, that local density dependence is more pervasive than previously assumed and is often caused by predation. However, there are currently insufficient data to test unequivocally whether or not any persistent metapopulation is regulated. The challenge for more complete understanding of regulation of metapopulations lies in combined empirical and theoretical studies that bridge the gap between smaller scale field experiments and larger scale phenomena that can presently be explored solely by theory.},

However, these techniques have received little notice from fisheries biologists, despite the widespread applicability to fisheries research, the wide variety of tag types used in fisheries research (from traditional fin clips to telemetry tags), and the development of new computer software to assist with analyses. We present a brief review of population models based on recaptures, returns, or telemetry relocations of tagged fish that can be used to estimate population size, total mortality, and components of mortality (i.e., fishing and natural) that are fre- quently of interest to fisheries biologists. Recommended strategies include (1) use closed population models (e.g., Lincoln-Peterson) to estimate population size for short term studies where closure assumption can be met, (2) use the robust design to esti- mate population size for studies of longer duration, (3) use high-reward tags in conjunction with other methods of estimating reporting rate in tag-return studies, (4) combine a subset of telemetry tagged fish with either a high-reward tagging program or a traditional capture-recapture study to improve mortality estimates and under- standing of mortality components, and (5) use pilot studies and simulation analyses to assess precision of estimated parameters to evaluate study feasibility. Incorporation of these improved techniques could lead to greater accuracy and precision of parameter estimates from tagging studies and thus to improved understanding and management of fish populations},

The assemblage was comprised of 10 statistically significant trophic guilds that were principally differentiated by the relative amounts of Mysida, Bivalvia, Polychaeta, Teleostei and other Crustacea in the diets. These guilds were broadly aggregated into five trophic categories: piscivores, zooplanktivores, benthivores, crustacivores and miscellaneous consumers. Food web structure was largely dictated by gradients in habitat (benthic to pelagic) and prey size. Size classes within piscivorous species were more likely to be classified into different guilds, reflecting stronger dietary changes through ontogeny relative to benthivores and other guilds. Relative to predator species and predator size, the month of sampling had negligible effects on dietary differences within the assemblage. A majority of sampled fishes derived most of their nutrition from non-pelagic prey sources, suggesting a strong coupling of fish production to benthic and demersal food resources. Mysida (predominantly the opossum shrimp Neomysis americana) contributed substantially to the diets of over 25% of the sampled predator groups, indicating that this species is a critical, but underappreciated, node in the Chesapeake Bay food web.},

   abstract = {Man has a major impact on marine environments through exploitation of fish resources. Fisheries can induce different selective pressures, either directly, i.e., through elevated mortality (which is often highly selective) or through ecosystem-level responses, as exploitation affects food availability and predation risk in both target and nontarget species. Responses to selection can be observed at two levels. First, at the community level, some species may suffer more from effects of harvesting than others; some may even increase in abundance. Responses by species to exploitation are associated with their life histories. In particular, species with late maturation at large size and with low population growth rate tend to undergo more pronounced declines than early-maturing species with rapid growth. Second, the phenotypic composition within species may also change. If phenotypic variability has a genetic basis, then fisheries-induced selection can result in evolutionary change in life-history traits influencing sustainable yields, behavioral traits (e.g., gear-avoidance behavior), and morphological traits. We discuss the possible implications of fisheries-induced adaptive changes for sustainable fisheries management},

To explore the relevance of misspecified reproductive schedules on sustainable fisheries, a range of types of skipped spawning was modeled for the Chesapeake Bay striped bass population to test for effects on the biological reference point of egg production per recruit. The influence of misspecified reproductive rates was minor, particularly in relation to the effects of the two alternative size limits (46 and 71 cm) that are most commonly used in fisheries management. Among misspecification scenarios, reduced frequency of spawning later in life had the largest effect on reproductive rate. As fisheries management increasingly focuses on thresholds that promote resiliency, increased recognition of variation in reproductive schedules will probably place greater emphasis on conservation of age structure.

   abstract = {Spawning stock biomass per recruit (SSBR) estimates the expected lifetime reproductive potential of an average recruit (P), which is an important correlate of population growth potential. The ratio of the fished to unfished magnitude of P is the spawning potential ratio (SPA) and is a measure of the impact of fishing on the potential productivity of a stock. Currenluse of SPR merges concepts developed to quantify the compensation required for population persistence given anthropogenic increases in mortality with observations of stock productivity and SSBR for fisheries in the Western North Atlantic. It has a firm theoretical basis and is evaluated against yield per recruit and contrasted with pther traditional biological reference points. SPR is widely used in U.S. fisheries managed under the Magnuson Fishery Conservation and Management Act, usually in the context of a percentage of the unflShed SSBR. lis implementation is intended to be risk-aversive through selection of minimum acceptable levels above which stocks maintain acceptable productivity. The behavior of the underlying principles suggests SPR values below about 0.2 should be avoided unless thare is evidence for exceptionally strong density-dependence in the stock. Critical levels have typically been set in the range of 0.2 to 0.3 primarily based upon the experience in the northwest Atlantic.},

   abstract = {ABSTRACT: Eleven years of eelgrass Zostera marina seed additions conducted in a coastal bay system where Z. marina had not been reported since 1933 have resulted in rapid Z. marina expansion beyond the initially seeded plots. From 1999 through 2010, 37.8 million viable seeds were added to 369 individual plots ranging in size from 0.01 to 2 ha totaling 125.2 ha in 4 coastal bays. Subsequent expansion from these initial plots to approximately 1700 ha of bay bottom populated with Z. marina through 2010 is attributable to seed export from the original plots and subsequent generations of seedlings originating from those exports. Estimates of annual patch vegetative expansion showed mean estimated diameter increasing at varying rates from 10 to 36 cm yr−1, consistent with rhizome elongation rates reported for Z. marina. Water quality data collected over 7 yr by spatially intensive sampling, as well as fixed-location continuous monitoring, document conditions in all 4 bays that are adequate to support Z. marina growth. In particular, median chlorophyll levels for the entire sampling period were between 5 and 6 µg l−1 for each of the bays, and median turbidity levels, while exhibiting seasonal differences, were between 8 and 9 NTU. The recovery of Z. marina initiated in this coastal bay system may be unique in seagrass recovery studies because of how the recovery was initiated (seeds rather than adult plants), how rapidly it occurred (years rather than decades), and the explicit demonstration of how one meadow modulated water clarity and altered sediments as it developed and expanded. Our results offer a new perspective on the role seeds can play in recovery dynamics at large spatial scales.},

   abstract = {The potential annual fecundity of Dover sole becomes fixed before the spawning season when the average diameter of the advanced stock of yolked oocytes exceeds 0.86 mm; hence potential annual fecundity is determinate. More central California females had atretic advanced oocytes than Oregon females, but rates of atresia were not sufficiently high to have an important effect on the potential annual fecundity of the population. A 1-kg female matured about 83,000 advanced yolked oocytes at the beginning of the season. Vitellogenesis continued for the advanced yolked oocytes during most of the spawning season while batches were repetitively matured and spawned. About nine batches were spawned over a six-month spawning season (December-May), and spawning ceased when the standing stock of advanced oocytes was exhausted. A 1-kg female released about 10,000 eggs per spawning, except for the first and last batches which were smaller than the rest. Near the end of the season, females may spawn more frequently than earlier in the year, increasing the daily production of eggs by the population even though fewer females are reproductively active. Annual reproductive effort of Dover sole was equivalent to about 14% of body wet weight per year. Fifty percent of the females had become sexually mature when they reached 332 mm total length. Various methodological issues were also treated in this paper, including validation of key assumptions underlying estimates of annual fecundity; fecundity sample-size requirements; evaluation of criteria and bias in estimating female sexual maturity; and comparisons of classification by histology and gross anatomy.},

   abstract = {In Puerto Rico, the environmental legislation for establishing marine protected areas (MPAs) is complex due to its current political position with the United States (US) as not only local but also federal US laws affect designations. Historically, during the Spanish rule, mangrove forests were protected for extractive reasons (i.e., charcoal) and the first protected area was established by 1918 as an Insular Forest. Currently, of the 37 MPAs recognized and investigated in this work, the vast majority (73%) are Natural Reserves, followed by Commonwealth Forests (13.5%). Most MPAs in Puerto Rico were implemented using a top-down approach (i.e., government) which follows US federal guidelines for protecting endangered species, critical habitats, and natural and cultural resources. The development of management plans for MPAs on the island is increasingly adopting a public participatory process. However, this latter process is new for the government of Puerto Rico that has not incorporated a policy based on an Integrated Coastal Management. ?? 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

For each fishery, we estimate current biological status and forecast the impacts of contrasting management regimes on catch, profit, and biomass of fish in the sea. We estimate unique recovery targets and trajectories for each fishery, calculate the year-by-year effects of alternative recovery approaches, and model how alternative institutional reforms affect recovery outcomes. Current status is highly heterogeneous—the median fishery is in poor health (overfished, with further overfishing occurring), although 32% of fisheries are in good biological, although not necessarily economic, condition. Our business-as-usual scenario projects further divergence and continued collapse for many of the world’s fisheries. Applying sound management reforms to global fisheries in our dataset could generate annual increases exceeding 16 million metric tons (MMT) in catch, $53 billion in profit, and 619 MMT in biomass relative to business as usual. We also find that, with appropriate reforms, recovery can happen quickly, with the median fishery taking under 10 y to reach recovery targets. Our results show that commonsense reforms to fishery management would dramatically improve overall fish abundance while increasing food security and profits.},

Understanding hetero- geneous responses to protected areas can improve targeting of management activities and help elucidate the pathways through which impacts of protect- ed areas occur. Here, we assessed whether the socioeconomic impacts of marine protected areas (MPAs)—designed to achieve goals for both conserva- tion and poverty alleviation—differed according to age, gender or religion in associated villages in North Sulawesi, Indonesia. Using data from pre-, mid- and post-implementation of the MPAs for control and project villages, we found little empirical evidence that impacts on five key socioeconomic indica- tors related to poverty differed according to social subgroup. We found suggestive empirical evidence that the effect of the MPAs on environmental knowledge differed by age and religion; over the medium and long terms, younger people and Muslims showed greater improvements compared with older people and Christians, respectively. 1.},

In some places, closed areas have been used for fisheries management for centuries [1] and, until recently, natural refugia also existed, inaccessible through depth, distance or adverse conditions. Developments in technology have left few areas of fishing interest beyond our reach. Recently, the idea of marine reserves as fisheries management tools has re-emerged with developing interest in ecosystem-based management, and observations of incidental fisheries benefits from reserves established for conservation. In light of new evidence, we argue that, by integrating large-scale networks of marine reserves into fishery management, we could reverse global fishery declines and provide urgently needed protection for marine species and their habitats.},

   abstract = {Although many papers report the effects of no-take marine protected areas (MPAs or reserves), scientifically rigorous empirical studies are rare, particularly for temperate reef fishes. We evaluated the responses of fish populations to protection from fishing in reserves by comparing densities and sizes inside and outside of five no-take reserves in southern California, USA. Our results are robust because we compared responses across multiple rocky-reef reserves in two different years and controlled for possible site differences by (a) ensuring that habitat characteristics were the same inside and outside reserves, and (b) sampling species that are not targeted, which would not be expected to have a direct response to fishing. We compared fish density and size and calculated biomass and egg production across all five sites. Fishes targeted by recreational and/or commercial fisheries consistently exhibited increases in mean density (150%), size (30%), biomass (440%), and egg production (730%) inside reserves. Reserve effects were greatest for legal-sized targeted fishes: significantly greater densities were found exclusively inside reserves for targeted species (580%), the largest size classes existed only inside reserves, and mean biomass was 1000% higher. These responses were unlikely to have been caused by habitat differences because there were no significant differences in habitat characteristics between reserve and control locations. Densities of non-targeted species did not differ between reserve and non-reserve locations, further supporting the conclusions that differences in targeted species between reserve and control locations were due to harvesting rather than site-specific effects. Although MPAs cannot replace traditional fisheries management, the concentration of increased biomass and egg production is a unique MPA benefit that serves both reserves and fisheries. Scientifically rigorous studies that include multiple reserves, such as this study, are needed to inform management and policy decisions.},

However, limited evidence currently exists that no-take marine reserves on the GBR have increased abundance of reef fish targeted by fisheries. This study provides such evidence for inshore reefs of the GBR.  2. Underwater visual surveys were used to estimate the effect of no-take reserves on abundance of species targeted by hook-and-line fisheries around the Palm, Whitsunday and Keppel Islands, spanning 600km of the length of the GBR. The reserves had been zoned ‘no fishing’ for 14 yr.  3. Densities of Plectropomus spp. and Lutjanus carponotatus, both targeted by fisheries, were much higher in protected zones than fished zones in two of the three island groups. Plectropomus spp. were 3.6 and 2.3 times more abundant in protected than fished zones of the Palm and Whitsunday island groups. L. carponotatus were 2.3 and 2.2 times more abundant in protected zones than fished zones of the Whitsunday and Keppel island groups.  4. The biomasses of Plectropomus spp. and L. carponotatus were significantly greater (3.9 and 2.6 times respectively) in the protected zones than fished zones at all three island groups.  5. Legal minimum sizes of Plectropomus spp. and L. carponotatus are 538 cm and 25 cm TL respectively. There were significantly higher densities and biomasses of Plectropomus spp. >35 cm TL (density: 3.8 times; biomass: 5.1 times) and L. carponotatus >25 cm TL (density: 4.2 times; biomass: 5.3 times) in protected zones than fished zones at all three island groups.  6. No significant difference in abundance between protected and fished zones was found for two species not captured by fisheries (Siganus doliatus and Chaetodon aureofasciatus), and there were no significant differences in benthic characteristics between protected and fished zones.  7. Results suggest that no-take marine reserves have increased stock biomass of targeted fish species on inshore GBR reefs.},

   abstract = {Closure of areas to fishing is expected to result in an increase in the abundance of targeted species; however, changes to populations of species not targeted by fishermen will depend upon their role in the ecosystem and their relationship with targeted species. The effects of protection on targeted and non-targeted reef fish species at the Houtman Abrolhos Islands, Western Australia were studied using baited remote underwater stereo–video cameras. Video images were collected from shallow (8–12 m) and deep (22–26 m) reef sites inside a Marine Protected Area (MPA) at each of three island groups and from three replicate fished locations at each of these groups that span a temperate-tropical transition area. The MPAs were established in 1994 and vary in size from 13.72 km 2 at the Pelsaert group in the south to 22.29 km 2 at the Easter group to 27.44 km 2 at the Wallabi group in the north. The relative abundances of 137 fish species from 42 families were recorded. Large differences in fish assemblage structure existed between MPA and fished locations, and also between shallow and deep regions. Targeted fish species Plectropomus leopardus , Lethrinus miniatus , Lethrinus nebulosus , Pagrus auratus and Glaucosoma hebraicum were more abundant inside MPAs than in areas open to fishing. Their abundance inside MPAs was between 1.13 and 8 times greater than their abundance at fished locations. For non-targeted fish species many were more abundant in areas open to fishing, e.g. Coris auricularis , Thalassoma lutescens , Thalassoma lunare , Dascyllus trimaculatus , however others were conversely more abundant inside MPAs, e.g. Gymnothorax spp, Kyphosus sydneyanus , Scarus microhinos , Chromis westaustralis , Chaetodon spp. This study demonstrates that the removal of abundant targeted species from an ecosystem by fishing can indirectly impact non-fished species and alter the trophic structure of fish assemblages.},

Discriminant functions based on five morphological characters correctly classified approximately 75% of the specimens. The effectiveness of three types of estimates based on these functions in accurately estimating stock proportions was investigated in a simulation study. Results of the simulation study indicated which type of estimate was least biased. A sampling design using geographical and temporal strata was then employed to sample the Atlantic coastal fishery from Cape Hatteras, N.C., to Maine. Observations for the morphological characters were taken on collected fish and the resulting data entered into discriminant functions obtained from spawning-stock collections. The specimens were classified by area of origin and the three types of estimates of relative contribution of the Hudson, Chesapeake, and Roanoke stocks were obtained. Results indicated that the Chesapeake stock was the major contributor to the Atlantic coastal striped bass fishery and the Hudson and Roanoke stocks were minor contributors},

During maturation in vitro, follicles undenvent a remarkable volume increase (about 340%) that was correlated with proteolysis of primarily the largest yolk protein in the oocyte. The maturation responsc of follicles to hCG was sire-dependent within a range from 400 to 600 m in diametcr, with a maximum response displayed by 530-600 m follicles. The response of these follicles to hCG was not inhibited within a range of incubation temperatures from 15 to 28°C , but the length of time required for the follicles to achieve 50% maturation was negatively correlated with increasing temperatures (r2 = 0.97; p 5 0.01). However, the largest follicles (530-600 pm) did not undergo maturation in response to high doses (1 pglml) of the major maturation-inducing steroids (MISS) known in teleosts, 17,20-dihydroxy-4-pregnen-3-one (17,20p) and 17,20@,21-trihydroxy-4-pregnen-3-one (20PS), even after a previous incubation period of follicles with 10 IUlml hCG for 1, 3 or 6 h. These observations indicate that C. striata follicles are very sensitive to increasing doses of gonadotropin, and that their responsiveness to this hormone is highly size-dependent within a very narrow range. The preliminary results also suggest that 17,20/3 and 20PS are not the MIS in this species.},

The proposed model is useful for situations where the variable of interest is continuous and restricted to the interval (0, 1) and is related to other variables through a regression structure. The regression parameters of the beta regression model are interpretable in terms of the mean of the response and, when the logit link is used, of an odds ratio, unlike the parameters of a linear regression that employs a transformed response. Estimation is performed by maximum likelihood. We provide closed-form expressions for the score function, for Fisher's information matrix and its inverse. Hypothesis testing is performed using approximations obtained from the asymptotic normality of the maximum likelihood estimator. Some diagnostic measures are introduced. Finally, practical applications that employ real data are presented and discussed. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

   abstract = {Since the early 1940s, several investigators have determined age-at-maturity schedules for female striped bass Morone saxatilis at various locations along the Atlantic coast of the USA. These researchers have used one of two sets of criteria to determine whether a female is sexually mature; however, recent work suggests that these methods may underestimate the number of females entering the spawning population at an early age (eg., ages 3 and 4). The objectives of our study were (1) to compare three methods and criteria for establishing sexual maturity and (2) to use all three methods in establishing a maturity schedule for female striped bass. Also, we estimated potential fecundity of the fish as a function of size, weight, and age. Two hundred sixty-five female striped bass were collected from the Roanoke River-Albemarle Sound system of North Carolina during the prespawning and spawning seasons (March-May) of 1989 and 1990. Females ranged in size from 344 to 1,172 mm fork length and in age from 2 to 16 years. Age-3 females produced approximately 200,000 eggs. The relationship between fish age and the number of eggs produced was statistically linear; one age-16 female produced approximately 5,000,000 eggs. Maturity estimates based on three methods were not significantly different; they indicated that about 44% of age-3 females were sexually mature and that all females examined were mature by age 6. These data suggest that female Roanoke striped bass may mature at an earlier age than striped bass in other systems. The proportion of females reaching sexual maturity by age 3 appears to be increasing in the Roanoke-Albemarle system; however, viability and year-class contribution of eggs spawned by age-3 females are unknown. The cause of the apparent downward shift in the maturation schedule is undetermined; environmental stress, fishing pressure, and genetic changes are possible factors. Until the viability and recruitment potential of eggs spawned by age-3 females can be ascertained, we recommend that management agencies consider age-4 females to be the first age-class that contributes to formation of Roanoke-Albemarle year-classes.},

   abstract = {Virginia's river fisheries for American shad have been under moratorium since 1994. The moratorium is partial since the three stocks (in the James, York, and Rappahannock rivers) are harvested to an unknown degree in an offshore mixed-stock fishery. Current research efforts have three objectives: (1) to determine current status of the stocks relative to historical levels, (2) to determine appropriate target catch-rate levels for restoration, and (3) to develop new assessment tools so that a future moratorium can be avoided. Current status is being evaluated by monitoring catch rate of commercial fishers who are paid to fish with historical methods in historical locations; the contemporary catch rates are compared to those recorded in logbooks completed voluntarily by fishers prior to the closure. We propose to define restoration targets in terms of historic catch rates recorded in logbooks. This requires determination of relative catching power of historic (multifilament) and modern (monofilament) nets. Two novel assessment methods are being evaluated: index-removal and change-in-ratio methods. These are based on comparing the catch rate and catch composition, respectively, of ripening fish and spent fish near the mouth of the river. During a moratorium, the parameters should be the same for ripening and spent fish, thus providing a critical check on the model assumptions. Maturity information is needed to forecast recruitment but previous estimates of maturity-at-age schedules are biased. Improved estimates can be obtained using anew statistical method which requires that there be a moratorium. It is unfortunate for society when a fish population declines to the point where a moratorium must be declared but a moratorium can provide important opportunities for testing methods and estimating parameters.},

   abstract = {Stocks of anadromous striped bass Morone saxatilis of the Atlantic coast have sup- ported important fisheries since colonial times. Commercial landings reached a record high in 1973, then declined by almost 90% during the following decade. Juvenile production by the Chesapeake Bay stock, a major contributor to coastal fisheries, was depressed during the 1970s. These patterns prompted efforts to identify why striped bass had declined and to rebuild the Chesapeake Bay stock. We review the history of the striped bass decline and the science, man- agement, and legislation that led to its recovery. Historical data and modeling results indicated that recruitment overfishing was a major factor in the decline. Juvenile production may have been further depressed by water quality problems that reduced survival of early life stages. Mathematical models demonstrated that reducing fishing mortality would immediately increase population growth rate, regardless of the decline’s cause. An Interstate Fishery Management Plan (the Plan) was adopted by the Atlantic States Marine Fisheries Commission in 1981 and amended in 1985 to protect females until 95% could spawn at least once, thus increasing age at entry from 2 to 8 years. The Plan was strengthened in 1984 by the Striped Bass Conservation Act (Public Law 98- 613), which required states to comply with the Plan or submit to federal moratoria. In 1985, states imposed moratoria or began a progressive increase in minimum size limits scheduled to reach 97 cm (38 in) in total length by 1990. Hatchery-reared striped bass were stocked in the Chesapeake Bay beginning in 1985 and may have accelerated recovery, though the benefits of stocking were far outweighed by the benefits of reducing fishing mortality. Abundance of females on spawning grounds in Maryland doubled between 1985 and 1988, and recruitment began to improve in 1989. Coastwide recreational catches increased more than 400% between 1985 and 1989. Regulations were relaxed in 1990 and an adaptive management scheme was adopted to allow limited harvest while the stock continued to recover. Recruitment continued to improve and the Chesapeake Bay stock was declared fully recovered in 1995, 10 years after stringent management measures were implemented.},

   abstract = {Density-dependent processes such as growth, survival, reproduction and movement are compensatory if their rates change in response to variation in population density (or numbers) such that they result in a slowed population growth rate at high densities and promote a numerical increase of the population at low densities. Compensatory density dependence is important to fisheries management because it operates to offset the losses of individuals. While the concept of compensation is straightforward, it remains one of the most controversial issues in population dynamics. The difficulties arise when going from general concepts to specific populations. Compensation is usually quantified using some combination of spawner–recruit analysis, long-term field monitoring or manipulative studies, and computer modelling. Problems arise because there are limitations to each of these approaches, and these limitations generally originate from the high uncertainty associated with field measurements. We offer a hierarchical approach to predicting and understanding compensation that ranges from the very general, using basic life-history theory, to the highly site-specific, using detailed population models. We analyse a spawner–recruit database to test the predictions about compensation and compensatory reserve that derive from a three-endpoint lifehistory framework designed for fish. We then summarise field examples of density dependence in specific processes. Selected long-term field monitoring studies, manipulative studies and computer modelling examples are then highlighted that illustrate how density-dependent processes led to compensatory responses at the population level. Some theoretical and empirical advances that offer hope for progress in the future on the compensation issue are discussed. We advocate an approach to compensation that involves process-level understanding of the underlying mechanisms, life-history theory, careful analysis of field data, and matrix and individual-based modelling. There will always be debate if the quantification of compensation does not include some degree of understanding of the underlying mechanisms.},

   abstract = {The striped bass (Morone saxatilis) is an economically and ecologically important finfish species along the Atlantic seaboard of the United States. Recent stock assessments in Chesapeake Bay (U.S.A.) indicate that non-fishing mortality in striped bass has increased since 1999, concomitant with very high (>50%) prevalence of visceral and dermal disease caused by Mycobacterium spp. Current fishery assessment models do not differentiate between disease and other components of non-fishing mortality (e.g., senescence, predation); therefore, disease impact on the striped bass population has not been established. Specific measurement of mortality associated with mycobacteriosis in wild striped bass is complicated because the disease is chronic and mortality is cryptic. Epidemiological models have been developed to estimate disease-associated mortality from cross-sectional prevalence data and have recently been generalized to represent disease processes more realistically. Here, we used this generalized approach to demonstrate disease-associated mortality in striped bass from Chesapeake Bay. To our knowledge this is the first demonstration of cryptic mortality associated with a chronic infectious disease in a wild finfish. This finding has direct implications for management and stock assessment of striped bass, as it demonstrates population-level negative impacts of a chronic disease. Additionally, this research provides a framework by which disease-associated mortality may be specifically addressed within fisheries models for resource management.},

   abstract = {Recent research suggests that maternal condition positively influences the number of eggs spawned in fishes. These studies commonly choose a priori to use body length rather than weight as an explanatory variable of offspring production, even though weight is usually the better predictor of fecundity. We are concerned that consistent exclusion of body weight as a predictor of egg production inflates the variance in fecundity attributable to maternal condition. By analysing data on three populations of Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua, Gadidae) and 10 populations of brook trout (Salvelinus fontinalis, Salmonidae), we illustrate the need for a statistically defensible method of model selection to distinguish the effects of maternal condition on egg production from the effects of body size alone. Forward stepwise regression and null model analyses reveal how length-based regressions can significantly over-estimate correlations between condition and fecundity, leading us to conclude that the effect of condition on egg productivity may not be as ubiquitous or as biologically important as previously thought. Our work underscores the need for greater statistical clarity in analyses of the effects of maternal condition on reproductive productivity in fishes.},

   abstract = {We developed a conceptual model of reproductive resilience based on spatio-temporal diversity in spawning activity and the 'big old fat fecund female fish' effect, i.e., trends in reproductive traits with size and age. We chose red snapper Lutjanus campechanus as our case study, as this species is highly fecund, currently overfished, and long-lived (50+ yr). The intrinsic reproductive resilience of red snapper was assessed in terms of spawning site distribution, variability in time of spawning, and potential reproductive lifespan. To assess how age truncation might erode reproductive resilience, we evaluated the strength of the relationship between size and age and the following traits: spawning habitat, reproductive timing, batch fecundity, and egg quality. Few fish were older than 7 yr. Although younger fish occurred in a more restricted range of depths, there was no trend between size or age and depth. Spawning activity was well distributed over space and time, with actively spawning females collected at 92 of 195 sampling sites over an extended spawning season. Larger, older females exhibited longer spawning periods and higher batch fecundities, but neither greater spawning frequency nor egg dry weight. The ratio of the effective to predicted reproductive lifespan at maximum sustainable yield was 31%. Many parameters estimated in this study are common to fish reproductive studies, but we hope that integrating them into a reproductive resilience framework will help focus the need for research on the underlying relationships between reproductive traits and stock productivity.},

   abstract = {Associative behaviour is defined as the spatial relationship between an animal (or a group) of a given species and another animal of another species, which is based on a decision by at least one of the two individuals to maintain contact with the other associate, but not for the purpose of feeding on the other. This definition is expanded to include objects and topographic structures (seamount, island, etc) that are not the exclusive habitat of the associated animal. Associations between fish and objects, mammals, topographic structures and other species of fish are reviewed, and the different hypotheses for these associations analysed. Finally, a generalisation of the meeting point hypothesis, fitting all types of association, is proposed. This hypothesis, initially applied to the association between tuna and floating objects, proposes that fish make use of animate or inanimate targets to increase the encounter rate between isolated individuals or small schools and other schools in order to constitute bigger schools that are more efficient to the survival of the species. It is strongly recommended to move from the scientific description of the association to specific experimental studies aimed at identifying ethological processes. This would provide a better understanding of the dynamics of associative behaviour of pelagic species, which in turn would permit better stock assessment and fishery management.},

   abstract = {Abstract: Customary management systems (i.e., management systems that limit the use of marine resources), such as rotational fisheries closures, can limit harvest of resources. Nevertheless, the explicit goals of customary management are often to influence fish behavior (in particular flight distance, i.e., distance at which an organism begins to flee an approaching threat), rather than fish abundance. We explored whether the flight distance of reef fishes targeted by local artisanal fishers differed between a customary closure and fished reefs. We also examined whether flight distance of these species affected fishing success and accuracy of underwater visual census (UVC) between customary closed areas and areas open to fishing. Several species demonstrated significant differences in flight distance between areas, indicating that fishing activity may increase flight distance. These relatively long flight distances mean that in fished areas most target species may stay out of the range of spear fishers. In addition, mean flight distances for all species both inside and outside the customary-closure area were substantially smaller than the observation distance of an observer conducting a belt-transect UVC (mean [SE]= 8.8 m [0.48]). For targeted species that showed little ability to evade spear fishers, customary closures may be a vital management technique. Our results show that customary closures can have a substantial, positive effect on resource availability and that conventional UVC techniques may be insensitive to changes in flight behavior of fishes associated with fishing. We argue that short, periodic openings of customary closures may allow the health of the fish community to be maintained and local fishers to effectively harvest fishes. Resumen: Los sistemas de manejo convencional (i.e., sistemas de manejo que limitan el uso de recursos marinos), como los encierros giratorios, pueden limitar la cosecha de recursos. Sin embargo, las metas explícitas del manejo convencional a menudo influyen sobre el comportamiento de los peces (en particular la distancia de escape, i.e., distancia a la cual un organismo comienza a escapar de una amenaza que se aproxima), y no sobre la abundancia. Exploramos sí la distancia de escape de peces de arrecife de coral explotados por pescadores artesanales locales difirió entre un encierro convencional y arrecifes sujetos a pesca. También examinamos sí la distancia de escape de estas especies afectaba el éxito de pesca y la precisión de los censos visuales submarinos (CVS) entre áreas con encierros convencionales y áreas abiertas a la pesca. Varias especies mostraron diferencias significativas en las distancias de escape entre áreas, lo cual indica que la actividad pesquera puede incrementar la distancia de escape. Estas distancias de escape relativamente altas significan que la mayoría de las especies en las áreas sujetas a pesca pueden estar fuera del alcance los pescadores con arpón. Adicionalmente, las distancias de escape promedio de todas las especies tanto afuera como adentro del área con encierro convencional fueron sustancialmente menores que la distancia de observación de un observador realizando un transecto CVS (media [ES]= 8.8 m [0.48]). Los encierros convencionales pueden ser una técnica de manejo vital para especies que mostraron poca habilidad para evadir a los pescadores con arpón. Nuestro resultados indican que los encierros convencionales pueden tener un efecto positivo sustancial sobre la disponibilidad de recursos que las técnicas convencionales de CVS pueden ser insensibles a los cambios en el comportamiento de escape de peces asociados con la pesca. Sostenemos que la apertura periódica, por corto tiempo, de los encierros convencionales podría ayudar a que se mantenga la salud de la comunidad de peces y que los pescadores locales cosechen peces efectivamente.},

   abstract = {The behavioural patterns of fish are the result of innate (‘built-in’) patterns of maturation (developmental changes) and of learning processes (imprinting and trial-and-error learning). Innate behavioural patterns are considered to be ‘hard-wired’ and inflexible. However, through learning, fish can adapt to environmental change. For instance, the homing behaviour of fish may be partly the result of the development of specific parts of the brain and partly because of changes in behaviour with experience. Similarly, one can assume that the feeding mode of fish involving snap-responses is innate, but learning enables fish to modify their foraging behaviour in response to a fluctuating environment. By reviewing these and other examples, such as the role of recognition learning and socially transmitted behaviour, one can illustrate the importance of learning in the everyday life of fishes. Although learning plays a large role in the behaviour of fishes, the learning capacity of fishes may also be useful to fisheries research and hatchery operations.},

We use information technology and tools to increase productivity and facilitate new forms of scholarship. For more information about JSTOR, please contact support@jstor.org. Summary 1. Risk effects of predators can profoundly affect community dynamics, but the nature of these effects is context dependent. 2. Although context dependence has hindered the development of a general framework for predicting the nature and extent of risk effects, recent studies suggest that such a framework is attainable if the factors that shape anti-predator behaviour, and its effectiveness, in natural communities are well understood. 3. One of these factors, the interaction of prey escape tactics and landscape features, has been largely overlooked. 4. We tested whether this interaction gives rise to interspecific variation in habitat-use patterns of sympatric large marine vertebrates at risk of tiger shark (Galeocerdo cuvier Peron and LeSueur, 1822) pr?dation. Specifically, we tested the a priori hypothesis that pied cormorants (Phalacrocorax varius Gmelin, 1789) would modify their use of shallow seagrass habitats in a manner opposite to that of previously studied dolphins (Tursiops aduncus Ehrenberg, 1833), dugongs \{Dugong dugon M?ller, 1776), and green turtles (Chelonia mydas Linnaeus, 1758) because, unlike these species, the effectiveness of cormorant escape behaviour does not vary spatially. 5. As predicted, cormorants used interior and edge portions of banks proportional to the abun dance of their potential prey when sharks were absent but shifted to interior portions of banks to minimize encounters with tiger sharks as pr?dation risk increased. Other shark prey, however, shift to edge microhabitats when shark densities increase to take advantage of easier escape despite higher encounter rates with sharks. 6. The interaction of landscape features and escape ability likely is important in diverse communities. 7. When escape probabilities are high in habitats with high predator density, risk effects of predators can reverse the direction of commonly assumed indirect effects of top predators. 8. The interaction between landscape features and prey escape tactics can result in a single predator species having differential effects on their sympatric prey that could cascade through ecosystems and should be incorporated into a general framework for context dependence of risk effects.},

   abstract = {'No-take' marine reserves provide a valuable tool for managing marine resources as well as for providing relatively undisturbed habitat with which to assess modifications to ecosystems. We studied 2 marine reserves in northeastern New Zealand, the Leigh Marine Reserve (established 1975) and Tawharanui Marine Park (established 1982) in order to assess whether changes in protected predator populations had resulted in other indirect changes to grazers and consequently to algal abundance. Estimates of abundance of the most common demersal predatory fish  Pagrus   auratus  indicated that adults of this species (i.e. large enough to prey upon urchins) were at least 5.75 and 8.70 times more abundant inside reserves than in adjacent unprotected areas. Overall,  P.   auratus  were also much larger inside reserves with mean total lengths of 316 mm compared with 186 mm in fished areas. The spiny lobster  Jasus   edwardsii  displayed similar trends, and was approximately 1.6 to 3.7 times more abundant inside the reserves than outside. Lobsters within the reserves had a mean carapace length of 109.9 mm, compared with 93.5 mm outside the reserves. In one of the reserves, densities of the sea urchin  Evechinus   chloroticus  had declined from 4.9 to 1.4 m -2 since 1978 in areas formerly dominated by it. Consequently, kelp forests were more extensive in 1998 than they were at the time of reserve creation. Urchin-dominated barrens occupied only 14% of available reef substratum in reserves as opposed to 40% in unprotected areas. These changes in community structure, which have persisted since at least 1994, demonstrate not only higher trophic complexity than anticipated in Australasian ecosystems but also increased primary and secondary productivity in marine reserves as a consequence of protection. Trends inside reserves indicate large-scale reduction of benthic primary production as an indirect result of fishing activity in unprotected areas.  },

The present study examined shark distribution patterns, species-habitat associations, and marine reserve use with baited remote underwater video stations (BRUVS) along the entire Great Barrier Reef Marine Park (GBRMP) over a ten year period. Overall, 21 species of sharks from five families and two orders were recorded. Grey reef Carcharhinus amblyrhynchos, silvertip C. albimarginatus, tiger Galeocerdo cuvier, and sliteye Loxodon macrorhinus sharks were the most abundant species (>64% of shark abundances). Multivariate regression trees showed that hard coral cover produced the primary split separating shark assemblages. Four indicator species had consistently higher abundances and contributed to explaining most of the differences in shark assemblages: C. amblyrhynchos, C. albimarginatus, G. cuvier, and whitetip reef Triaenodon obesus sharks. Relative distance along the GBRMP had the greatest influence on shark occurrence and species richness, which increased at both ends of the sampling range (southern and northern sites) relative to intermediate latitudes. Hard coral cover and distance across the shelf were also important predictors of shark distribution. The relative abundance of sharks was significantly higher in non-fished sites, highlighting the conservation value and benefits of the GBRMP zoning. However, our results also showed that hard coral cover had a large effect on the abundance of reef-associated shark species, indicating that coral reef health may be important for the success of marine protected areas. Therefore, understanding shark distribution patterns, species-habitat associations, and the drivers responsible for those patterns is essential for developing sound management and conservation approaches.},

   abstract = {Reef sharks play important roles in tropical reef environments, but population declines have occurred in various locations including the Great Barrier Reef (GBR). While many reef shark studies focus on coral reefs, some reef sharks have been found across a range of inshore and coastal habitats. This study analyses fisheries observer data across large spatial scales (19314 km2) to investigate the occurrence of reef sharks amongst a mosaic of inshore habitats in the GBR lagoon. Six reef shark species were recorded, but comprised a relatively small proportion (1.8% by number) of the elasmobranch catch. The blacktip reef shark dominated the catch of reef sharks (60.2% by number), with lemon sharks, zebra sharks, grey carpet sharks, whitetip reef sharks and grey reef sharks less frequently encountered. Reef sharks occur in several habitat types, and logistic regression models suggest that they are most likely to occur in reef habitats and shallow shore habitats. The presence of a reef within 2 km increased the encounter probability in all habitat types. While the use of these different habitats by reef sharks is not well understood, these habitat use patterns affect the exposure of these species to risks, including some risk factors not considered previously, and could also lead to cumulative impacts. These habitats may also per- form important ecological functions in sustaining reef shark populations. Habitat use patterns should be considered in risk assessments and management and have important implications for method selection and survey design in field studies of reef sharks and other mobile reef species.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Most ecological models assume that predator and prey populations interact solely through consumption: predators reduce prey densities by killing and consuming individual prey. However, predators can also reduce prey densities by forcing prey to adopt costly defensive strategies.\n\nMETHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We build on a simple Lotka-Volterra predator-prey model to provide a heuristic tool for distinguishing between the demographic effects of consumption (consumptive effects) and of anti-predator defenses (nonconsumptive effects), and for distinguishing among the multiple mechanisms by which anti-predator defenses might reduce prey population growth rates. We illustrate these alternative pathways for nonconsumptive effects with selected empirical examples, and use a meta-analysis of published literature to estimate the mean effect size of each pathway. Overall, predation risk tends to have a much larger impact on prey foraging behavior than measures of growth, survivorship, or fecundity.\n\nCONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: While our model provides a concise framework for understanding the many potential NCE pathways and their relationships to each other, our results confirm empirical research showing that prey are able to partially compensate for changes in energy income, mitigating the fitness effects of defensive changes in time budgets. Distinguishing the many facets of nonconsumptive effects raises some novel questions, and will help guide both empirical and theoretical studies of how predation risk affects prey dynamics.},

Because prey trade-off predation risk for foraging gains, the magnitude of predators' non-consumptive effects should depend on resource availability. Studies of non-consumptive effects generally adopt either of two strategies: (i) maintaining a static ration of the prey's resources; and (ii) using resource populations that vary dynamically in response to prey behaviour. Contrasting these experimental designs using meta-analysis, we evaluated whether resource dynamics influence the magnitude of non-consumptive effects on prey growth, survival, fecundity, population density, foraging rate and habitat use. Predators had a more negative effect on prey demography in dynamic- vs. static-resource experiments. Our results highlight the importance of resource dynamics in mediating the magnitude of non-consumptive effects of predators on prey, and illustrate the often-unintended impacts of experimental design on estimates of effect size in ecological interactions.},

The overall conclusion was that future research and management efforts should increasingly focus on the feedbacks between the interacting human and ecological components of recreational fisheries. Doing so promises to improve understanding of how recreational fisheries respond to social–ecological change. In this context, the behaviour of both fishes and humans provides an important, yet often overlooked, integrator of the ecological and social components of recreational fisheries. A better understanding of the behavioural dynamics of recreational fishers as well as exploited fishes will help predict how recreational fisheries change, evolve, adapt and reorganise through time to maintain resilience and achieve sustainability on a global scale.},

   abstract = {Any attempt to describe the spatial ecology of sharks and rays should consider the drivers responsible for movement. Research has shown fluctuations in the environment (abiotic factors) can trigger movement and changes in behaviour and habitat use for many elasmobranch species. Most studies to date have selectively focused on a small number of abiotic factors (i.e. temperature, salinity); however, other factors such as dissolved oxygen, tide, photoperiod, barometric pressure and pH have also been documented to act as drivers of movement in shark and ray species. Although usually examined individually, abiotic factors rarely act in isolation and often differ in their level of influence between species, sex, ontogenetic stage, season and geographic location. This paper reviews the role of abiotic factors as a driver of movement and changes in behaviour and habitat use in elasmobranchs. In the context of a changing climate, insight into how sharks and rays may respond to fluctuating environmental conditions projected under future scenarios is required.},

   abstract = {Fish welfare issues are increasingly appearing on social and political agendas and have recently gained prominence in fisheries literature. By focusing on examples from recreational fishing, this paper challenges some of the previous accounts of fish welfare. Issues of concern encompass: (1) the feelings-based approach to fish welfare; (2) the artificial divide between human beings and nature; and (3) ways in which stakeholders can address fish welfare issues. The different approaches to characterizing the interaction of humans with animals are animal welfare, animal liberation and animal rights. We show that the suffering-centred approaches to fish welfare and the extension of the moral domain to fish – characteristic of the concepts of animal liberation and animal rights – are not the cornerstone of animal welfare. This, however, does not question the need of fisheries stakeholders to consider the well-being of fish when interacting with them. There are many ways in which recreational fishing stakeholders can modify standard practices to improve the welfare of fish, without questioning fishing as an activity per se. Examples are choice of gear and handling techniques. Previous accounts have failed to include discussions of the many efforts – voluntary or mandated – pursued by fisheries stakeholders to reduce fish stress, injury and mortality. Progress towards addressing fish welfare issues will be enhanced by avoiding the viewing of humans as ‘non-natural’ disturbance to fishes and keeping three types of crucial question in separate compartments. The three questions cover the symptoms of good and poor welfare, the conscious experience of suffering, and the ethical attitudes towards animals. Fish biologists should focus on the first question – objective measurement of biochemical, physiological and behavioural indicators – to evaluate whether human interactions with fish impair the latters’ health or prevent them from receiving what they need, if held in captivity.},

   abstract = {Replicated ecological studies in marine reserves and associated unprotected areas are valuable in examining top-down impacts on communities and the ecosystem-level effects of fishing. We carried out experimental studies in two temperate marine reserves to examine these top-down influences on shallow subtidal reef communities in northeastern New Zealand. Both reserves examined are known to support high densities of predators and tethering experiments showed that the chance of predation on the dominant sea urchin, Evechinus chloroticus, within both reserves was approximately 7 times higher relative to outside. Predation was most intense on the smallest size class (30–40 mm) of tethered urchins, the size at which urchins cease to exhibit cryptic behaviour. A high proportion of predation on large urchins could be attributed to the spiny lobster, Jasus edwardsii. Predation on the smaller classes was probably by both lobsters and predatory fish, predominantly the sparid Pagrus auratus. The density of adult Evechinus actively grazing the substratum in the urchin barrens habitat was found to be significantly lower at marine reserve sites (2.2±0.3 m–2) relative to non-reserve sites (5.5±0.4 m–2). There was no difference in the density of cryptic juveniles between reserve and non-reserve sites. Reserve populations were more bimodal, with urchins between 40 and 55 mm occurring at very low numbers. Experimental removal of Evechinus from the urchin barrens habitat over 12 months lead to a change from a crustose coralline algal habitat to a macroalgal dominated habitat. Such macroalgal habitats were found to be more extensive in both reserves, where urchin densities were lower, relative to the adjacent unprotected areas that were dominated by urchin barrens. The patterns observed provide evidence for a top-down role of predators in structuring shallow reef communities in northeastern New Zealand and demonstrate how marine reserves can reverse the indirect effects of fishing and re-establish community-level trophic cascades.},

These islands have produced some of the best evidence available that no-take reserves, protected and managed by local communities, can play a key role in biodiversity conservation and fisheries management. Perhaps more importantly, they served as models for an extraordinary expansion of no-take reserves nationally in the Philippines in the past 2 decades. This expansion contributed substantially to a major shift in national policy of management of marine resources. This policy shift partially devolved responsibility from a centralized government bureaucracy to local governments and local communities. Local governments now comanage, along with the national government, marine resources out to 15 km from the coast. Giving some responsibility for management of marine resources to coastal people dependent upon those resources represents, in a very real sense, another "people power revolution" in the Philippines.},

   abstract = {The study and implementation of no-take marine reserves have increased rapidly over the past decade, providing ample data on the biological effects of reserve protection for a wide range of geographic locations and organisms. The plethora of new studies affords the opportunity to re- evaluate previous findings and address formerly unanswered questions with extensive data synthe- ses. Our results show, on average, positive effects of reserve protection on the biomass, numerical density, species richness, and size of organisms within their boundaries which are remarkably simi- lar to those of past syntheses despite a near doubling of data. New analyses indicate that (1) these results do not appear to be an artifact of reserves being sited in better locations; (2) results do not appear to be driven by displaced fishing effort outside of reserves; (3) contrary to often-made asser- tions, reserves have similar if not greater positive effects in temperate settings, at least for reef ecosystems; (4) even small reserves can produce significant biological responses irrespective of lati- tude, although more data are needed to test whether reserve effects scale with reserve size; and (5) effects of reserves vary for different taxonomic groups and for taxa with various characteristics, and not all species increase in response to reserve protection. There is considerable variation in the responses documented across all the reserves in our data set—variability which cannot be entirely explained by which species were studied. We suggest that reserve characteristics and context, par- ticularly the intensity of fishing outside the reserve and inside the reserve before implementation, play key roles in determining the direction and magnitude of the reserve response. However, despite considerable variability, positive responses are far more common than no differences or negative responses, validating the potential for well designed and enforced reserves to serve as globally important conservation and management tools},

   abstract = {An important principle of environmental science is that changes in single components of systems are likely to have consequences elsewhere in the same systems. In the sea, food web data are one of the few foundations for predicting such indirect effects, whether of fishery exploitation or following recovery in marine protected areas (MPAs). We review the available literature on one type of indirect interaction in benthic marine ecosystems, namely trophic cascades, which involve three or more trophic levels connected by predation, Because many indirect effects have been revealed through fishery exploitation, in some cases we include humans as trophic levels. Our purpose is to establish how widespread cascades might be, and infer how likely they are to affect the properties of communities following the implementation of MPAs or intensive resource exploitation We review 39 documented cascades (eight of which include humans as a trophic level) from 21 locations around the world; all but two of the cascades are from shallow systems underlain by hard substrata (kelp forests, rocky subtidal, coral reefs and rocky intertidal), We argue that these systems are well represented because they are accessible and also amenable to the type of work that is necessary, Nineteen examples come from the central-eastern and north-eastern Pacific, while no well-substantiated benthic cascades have been reported from the NE, CE or SW Atlantic, the Southern Oceans, E Indian Ocean or NW Pacific, The absence of examples from those zones is probably due to lack of study. Sea urchins are very prominent in the subtidal examples, and gastropods, especially limpets, in the intertidal examples; we suggest that this may reflect their predation by fewer specialist predators than is the case with fishes, but also their conspicuousness to investigators. The variation in ecological resolution amongst studies, and in intensity of study amongst systems and regions, indicates that more cascades will likely be identified in due course. Broadening the concept of cascades to include pathogenic interactions would immediately increase the number of examples. The existing evidence is that cascade effects are to be expected when hard-substratum systems are subject to artisanal resource exploitation, but that the particular problems of macroalgal overgrowth on Caribbean reefs and the expansion of coralline barrens in the Mediterranean rocky-sublittoral will not be readily reversed in MPAs, probably because factors other than predation-based cascades have contributed to them in the first place. More cascade effects are likely to be found in the soft-substratum systems that are crucial to so many large-scale fisheries, when opportunities such as those of MPAs and fishing gradients become available for study of such systems, and the search is widened to less conspicuous focal organisms such as polychaetes and crustaceans},

   abstract = {As coastal species experience increasing anthropogenic pressures there is a growing need to characterise the ecological drivers of their abundance and habitat use, and understand how they may respond to changes in their environment. Accordingly, fishery-independent surveys were undertaken to investigate shark abundance along approximately 400 km of the tropical east coast of Australia. Generalised linear models were used to identify ecological drivers of the abundance of immature blacktip Carcharhinus tilstoni/Carcharhinus limbatus, pigeye Carcharhinus amboinensis, and scalloped hammerhead Sphyrna lewini sharks. Results indicated general and species-specific patterns in abundance that were characterised by a range of abiotic and biotic variables. Relationships with turbidity and salinity were similar across multiple species, highlighting the importance of these variables in the functioning of communal shark nurseries. In particular, turbid environments were especially important for all species at typical oceanic salinities. Mangrove proximity, depth, and water temperature were also important; however, their influence varied between species. Ecological drivers may promote spatial diversity in habitat use along environmentally heterogeneous coastlines and may therefore have important implications for population resilience.},

   abstract = {<p>No-take marine protected areas (MPAs) are assumed to enhance fisheries catch via the “spillover” effect, where biomass is exported to adjacent exploited areas. Recent studies in spearfishing fisheries suggest that the spillover of gear-naïve individuals from protected to unprotected sites increases catch rates outside the boundaries of MPAs. Whether this is a widespread phenomenon that also holds for other gear types and species is unknown. In this study, we tested if the distance to a Mediterranean MPA predicted the degree of vulnerability to hook and line in four small-bodied coastal fish species. With the assistance of underwater video recording, we investigated the interaction effect of the distance to the boundary of an MPA and species type relative to the latency time to ingest a natural bait, which was considered as a surrogate of fish naïveté or vulnerability to fishing. Vulnerability to angling increased (i.e., latency time decreased) within and near the boundary of an MPA for an intrinsically highly catchable species (<italic>Serranus scriba</italic>), while it remained constant for an intrinsically uncatchable control species (<italic>Chromis chromis</italic>). While all of the individuals of <italic>S</italic>. <italic>scriba</italic> observed within the MPA and surrounding areas were in essence captured by angling gear, only one fifth of individuals in the far locations were captured. This supports the potential for the spillover of gear-naïve and consequently more vulnerable fish from no-take MPAs. Two other species initially characterized as intermediately catchable (<italic>Coris julis</italic> and <italic>Diplodus annularis</italic>) also had a shorter latency time in the vicinity of an MPA, but for these two cases the trend was not statistically significant. Overall, our results suggest that an MPA-induced naïveté effect may not be universal and may be confined to only intrinsically highly catchable fish species. This fact emphasizes the importance of considering the behavioural dimension when predicting the outcomes of MPAs, otherwise the effective contribution may be smaller than predicted for certain highly catchable species such as <italic>S</italic>. <italic>scriba</italic>.</p>},

Continuous predictive maps of the length distributions for each of the six study species across approximately 200 km 2  of the study area were created from these models. The spatial patterns in habitat partitioning by individuals of different body lengths for all six study species provide strong evidence for ontogenetic shifts. This highlights the importance of considering ontogenetic processes for marine spatial management. Importantly, predictive hotspot maps were created that identify potential areas that accumulate individuals of similar life stages of multiple species (e.g., multispecies nursery areas). In circumstances where limited resources are available for monitoring and management of fish resources, predictive modelling is a valuable tool for studying previously overlooked processes such as ontogenetic habitat shifts. Predictive modelling provides crucial information that elucidates spatial patterns in community composition across mosaics of benthic habitats. This novel technique can contribute to the spatial management of coastal fish and fisheries by identifying areas that are important for different life history stages of multiple fish species.},

   abstract = {A survey of coastal recreational boat fishing was conducted in summer 2006 in the marine reserve of Cap de Creus (NW Mediterranean) to assess the biological and socioeconomic implications of this leisure activity. Recreational boat fishers employ four different fishing techniques: bottom fishing rod, fluixa, trolling and surface fishing rod. Although the targeted species depend on the fishing method used, a total of 33 fish species were identified in the catch (8 were pelagic or benthopelagic and the rest were demersal). Fishing effort was high since fishers fished an average of 4 h/day, 8 days/month and nearly 6 months/year. Apart from the highly varied exploitation of the fauna, recreational fishing in Cap de Creus has a large economic effect on the local economy since the majority of fishers were visitors who were spending holidays in one of the villages belonging to the Park, where most of expenditures related to angling activities were made. Overall, results highlight the pressure that recreational boat fishing exerts on fish communities, particularly on littoral, demersal ones. Considering these biological and socioeconomic implications, the competition between recreational and artisanal fishers for littoral resources and the low level of compliance with the current sport fishing regulations, the implementation of a comprehensive management strategy in Mediterranean costal areas is needed. ?? 2007 Elsevier B.V.

We also review our current understanding of the effects of catch-and-release angling on black bass and provide direction for future research. Collectively our data suggest that all angling elicits a stress response, however, the magnitude of this response is determined by the degree of exhaustion and varies with water temperature. Our results also suggest that air exposure, especially following exhaustive exercise, places an additional stress on fish that increases the time needed for recovery and likely the probability of death. Simulated tournament conditions revealed that metabolic rates of captured fish increase with live-well densities greater than one individual, placing a greater demand on live-well oxygen conditions. The repeated handling of fish during tournament angling, including culling, the addition of fish or other live-well disturbances, and the final tournament weigh-in, which adds an additional several minutes of air exposure, further adds to already heightened stress levels. When these cumulative stressors do not result in death, the resultant energetic disruptions clearly have negative impacts not only on the short term health and condition of the fish, but also most likely on its biological fitness (i.e., its lifetime reproductive success). We also show that following angling, nest-guarding male bass face a reduction in their locomotory activity that may reduce their ability to successfully defend the nest. Although most concerns about catch-and-release angling occur at the population and community level, out assessment of various angling, handling and retention practices identifies ways to minimize the effects of angling upon individual fish and to ensure that these effects do not manifest themselves as problems at the population level.},

   abstract = {<p>No-take marine protected areas (MPAs) are assumed to enhance fisheries catch via the “spillover” effect, where biomass is exported to adjacent exploited areas. Recent studies in spearfishing fisheries suggest that the spillover of gear-naïve individuals from protected to unprotected sites increases catch rates outside the boundaries of MPAs. Whether this is a widespread phenomenon that also holds for other gear types and species is unknown. In this study, we tested if the distance to a Mediterranean MPA predicted the degree of vulnerability to hook and line in four small-bodied coastal fish species. With the assistance of underwater video recording, we investigated the interaction effect of the distance to the boundary of an MPA and species type relative to the latency time to ingest a natural bait, which was considered as a surrogate of fish naïveté or vulnerability to fishing. Vulnerability to angling increased (i.e., latency time decreased) within and near the boundary of an MPA for an intrinsically highly catchable species (<italic>Serranus scriba</italic>), while it remained constant for an intrinsically uncatchable control species (<italic>Chromis chromis</italic>). While all of the individuals of <italic>S</italic>. <italic>scriba</italic> observed within the MPA and surrounding areas were in essence captured by angling gear, only one fifth of individuals in the far locations were captured. This supports the potential for the spillover of gear-naïve and consequently more vulnerable fish from no-take MPAs. Two other species initially characterized as intermediately catchable (<italic>Coris julis</italic> and <italic>Diplodus annularis</italic>) also had a shorter latency time in the vicinity of an MPA, but for these two cases the trend was not statistically significant. Overall, our results suggest that an MPA-induced naïveté effect may not be universal and may be confined to only intrinsically highly catchable fish species. This fact emphasizes the importance of considering the behavioural dimension when predicting the outcomes of MPAs, otherwise the effective contribution may be smaller than predicted for certain highly catchable species such as <italic>S</italic>. <italic>scriba</italic>.</p>},

MSE can be used to identify a ‘best’ management strategy among a set of candidate strategies, or to determine how well an existing strategy performs. The ability of MSE to facilitate fisheries management achieving its aims depends on how well uncertainty is represented, and how effectively the results of simulations are summarized and presented to the decision-makers. Key challenges for effective use of MSE therefore include characterizing objectives and uncertainty, assigning plausibility ranks to the trials considered, and working with decision- makers to interpret and implement the results of the MSE. This paper explores how MSEs are conducted and characterizes current ‘best practice’ guidelines, while also indicating whether and how these best practices were applied to two case- studies: the Bering–Chukchi–Beaufort Seas bowhead whales (Balaena mysticetus; Balaenidae) and the northern subpopulation of Pacific sardine (Sardinops sagax caerulea; Clupeidae).},

   abstract = {A survey of coastal recreational boat fishing was conducted in summer 2006 in the marine reserve of Cap de Creus (NW Mediterranean) to assess the biological and socioeconomic implications of this leisure activity. Recreational boat fishers employ four different fishing techniques: bottom fishing rod, fluixa, trolling and surface fishing rod. Although the targeted species depend on the fishing method used, a total of 33 fish species were identified in the catch (8 were pelagic or benthopelagic and the rest were demersal). Fishing effort was high since fishers fished an average of 4 h/day, 8 days/month and nearly 6 months/year. Apart from the highly varied exploitation of the fauna, recreational fishing in Cap de Creus has a large economic effect on the local economy since the majority of fishers were visitors who were spending holidays in one of the villages belonging to the Park, where most of expenditures related to angling activities were made. Overall, results highlight the pressure that recreational boat fishing exerts on fish communities, particularly on littoral, demersal ones. Considering these biological and socioeconomic implications, the competition between recreational and artisanal fishers for littoral resources and the low level of compliance with the current sport fishing regulations, the implementation of a comprehensive management strategy in Mediterranean costal areas is needed. ?? 2007 Elsevier B.V.

Winter and summer flounder underwent ontogenetic dietary shifts. Winter flounder  < 40 mm TL predominantly fed on copepods, transitioning to amphipods, isopods, and bivalves with increasing size. Polychaetes also were consumed frequently by winter flounder, irrespective of size. The principal prey of summer flounder  < 60 mm TL were mysid shrimp and copepods, whereas sand shrimp (Crangon septemspinosa), amphipods, and fish were the dominant prey of larger conspecifics. There was minimal dietary overlap for the flounder species when comparisons were made independent of body size, indicating food niche segregation. For winter and summer flounder of equivalent sizes, however, dietary overlap was inversely related to TL. Moderate to high resource overlap occurred for small winter and summer flounder ( < 40 mm TL) and was attributed to their mutual reliance on copepods and amphipods. Despite evidence of dietary overlap, it is unlikely that shared prey resources were diminished enough to negatively affect either flounder species.},

Juvenile gray snapper were collected over two consecutive years from sea grass meadows with a benthic scrape and otter trawl. Spawning, settlement, and growth patterns were compared across three sampling regions (Panhandle, Big bend, and Southwest) by using otolith microstructure. Histology of adult gonads was also used for an independent estimate of spawning time. Daily growth increments were visible in the lapilli of snapper 11-150 mm standard length; ages ranged from 38 to 229 days and estimated average planktonic larval duration was 25 days. Estimated growth rates ranged from 0.60 to 1.02 mm/d and did not differ among the three sampling regions, but did differ across sampling years. Back-calculated fertilization dates from otoliths indicated that juveniles in the Panhandle and Big Bend were mainly summer spawned fish, whereas Southwest juveniles had winter and summer fertilization dates. Settlement occurred during summer both years and in the winter of 1997 for the southern portion of the WFS. Moon phase did not appear to be strongly correlated with fertilization or settlement. Histological samples of gonads from adults collected near the juvenile sampling areas indicated a summer spawning period.},

The energetic response of juvenile gray snapper to temperature and salinity was measured in laboratory experiments to determine the influence of these physicochemical factors on the potential value of different juvenile nurseries. Maximum consumption and growth rates of juvenile (25-50 mm SL) gray snapper were determined in 12-day trials at 20 temperature/salinity combinations representing conditions in juvenile habitats. Ad libitum feeding level of individual fish was measured daily. Maximum weight specific feeding rate increased significantly with temperature and salinity; however, the effect of salinity was much less than that of temperature. Linear growth rate and specific growth rate both increased with temperature, and salinity did not have a significant effect on either. Gross growth efficiency (K 1, growthxconsumption -1*100) increased with temperature and was significantly lower at high salinities, indicating increased energetic costs. The higher K 1 at lower salinities has several implications for juvenile gray snapper in low salinity habitats: (1) they would need less food to achieve the same somatic growth as juveniles in high salinity habitats; (2) they would have higher growth at limited ration levels as compared to high salinity habitats; and (3) they would have less impact on prey populations than higher salinity habitats assuming similar gray snapper densities. © 2004 Elsevier B.V.

   abstract = {Applying spatially varied management actions can be a valuable component of an ecosystem-based approach to fisheries management. However, detecting the benefits of spatial management actions can be difficult, especially considering the large spatial range of most fished stocks. The common snook (Centropomus undecimalis) is a premier target species in Florida's estuaries and the fishery is entirely recreational with 96% of the fish caught returned to the water by anglers. However, the management conservation objective of maintaining a spawning potential ratio (SPR) greater than 40% is not always achieved under current regulatory practices. We developed a spatially explicit, age-based, dynamic simulation model to evaluate management actions that could achieve target SPR objectives by incorporating spatial closures. The snook stocks of the east and west coasts of Florida were both assumed to be comprised of three substocks that each occupied a separate estuarine system with limited larval and adult interconnectivity. The model was used to evaluate scenarios incorporating different combinations of closures. A scenario that had partial snook-fishing closures (two systems allowing catch-and-release fishing only and one system also allowing snook harvest) was compared with a scenario in which all three systems had snook harvest. The partially closed scenario attained balanced results with 60% SPR, 54% of the unfished abundance of trophy-size snook, 48% of maximum harvest in numbers, and 51% of maximum yield in weight. In contrast, the fully fished scenario resulted in overfishing with 25% SPR, 15% of the unfished abundance of trophy-size snook, 98% of maximum harvest, and 99% of maximum yield.

However, most evidence of such movement has been inferred from density and size structure differences among these habitats in tropical waters. The aim of the present Study was to directly evaluate multiple habitat use by an ecologically and economically important reef fish, the gray snapper Lutjanus griseus, in subtropical waters. An integrated set of activities was conducted, including tagging and tracking of individuals and underwater video photography to examine the spatial and temporal dynamics of movements among neighboring mangrove, seagrass, and coral reef habitats in the northern Florida Keys, USA. Results of ultrasonic acoustic and mini-archival tagging indicated that L. griseus exhibits: (1) a distinct diel migration pattern, whereby shallow seagrass beds; are frequented nocturnally and mangroves and other habitats with complex structure are occupied diurnally, and (2) bay-to-ocean movement, occurring during the known spawning season of L. griseus in this region. Video photography confirmed diel movement among seagrass and mangrove habitats. Results of this subtropical study corroborate direct and indirect evidence obtained in tropical waters of multiple inshore habitat use by L. griseus, as well as its seasonal movement into or towards offshore reefs. For resource managers charged with designing and implementing management plans for subtropical coastal habitats and fisheries, our findings provide direct support for the strategy of conserving both inshore seagrass and mangrove habitats as well as offshore coral reefs.},

   abstract = {Field observations were supplemented with laboratory experiments to reveal patterns of salinity selection and preference for grey snapper Lutjanus griseus (c. 21 cm total length, L(T)), an ecologically and economically important species in the south-eastern U.S.A. Fish abundance data were examined from a long-term field survey conducted in the mangrove habitats of Biscayne Bay, Florida, where salinities ranged from <1 to 40. First, regression analyses indicated significant, positive linear relationships with salinity for both L. griseus frequency of occurrence and concentration (density when present). These patterns are inconsistent with physiological expectations of minimizing energetic osmoregulatory costs. Next, the salinity preference and swimming activity of 11 L. griseus (ranging from 18 to 23 cm L(T)) were investigated using a newly developed electronic shuttlebox system. In the laboratory, fish preferred intermediate salinities in the range of 9-23. Swimming activity (measured in terms of spontaneous swimming speed) followed a parabolic relationship with salinity, with reduced activity at salinity extremes perhaps reflecting compensation for higher osmoregulatory costs. It is suspected that the basis of the discrepancy between laboratory and field observations for size classes at or near maturity ultimately relates to the reproductive imperative to move towards offshore (high-salinity) coral-reef habitats, a necessity that probably overrides the strategy of minimizing osmoregulatory energetic costs.},

   abstract = {Abstract: Estuarine-dependent Gray Snapper Lutjanus griseus support extensive recreational fisheries in estuarine and coastal waters throughout the eastern Gulf of Mexico. Multiyear fisheries-independent monitoring data collected in three Florida estuaries can be used to estimate the strength of juvenile Gray Snapper recruitment, which has been critical to assessments of other fish populations. Earlier evaluation of these data indicated that Gray Snapper inhabit polyhaline seagrass beds, which are underrepresented in ongoing monitoring efforts. During this study, in addition to the routine monitoring of shorelines and channel habitats, sampling of shoal and deepwater polyhaline seagrass habitats was implemented using 183-m haul seines and 6.1-m otter trawls. The incorporation of polyhaline seagrass surveys from 2008 through 2011 allowed a more thorough sampling of the Gray Snapper population, resulting in improved catch rates, increased frequency of occurrence, and a substantial reduction of the coefficient of variation for CPUE in most years and estuarine systems. Habitat-based sampling of polyhaline seagrass habitats also provided additional data for annual abundance indices and therefore improved the ability to characterize the strength of recruitment for Gray Snapper over time. These results demonstrated that periodically reevaluating habitat-based stratification approaches to estimate fish abundance indices from long-term surveys can lead to more precise estimates and greater numbers of measured individuals, which are key components of successful monitoring programs.

Our objective was to characterize discard mortality for the Gray Snapper recreational fishery in a study area that was representative of the regions in which most of the recreational fishing for this species takes place. In total, 247 Gray Snapper were caught during short-term (48-h) discard mortality experiments; 17 of the fish died, resulting in an overall mortality rate of 6.9%. Discard mortality was lower for fish caught from inshore waters (2/143 fish; 1.4%) than for those captured from the nearshore zone (15/ 104 fish; 14.4%). The water depth at the capture site and the anatomical hook location significantly influenced the probability of mortality. Individuals that were caught in shallower water and that were hooked in the lip were most likely to survive catch and release, whereas fish that were hooked in the esophagus were least likely to survive.},

Juvenile and subadult gray snapper were collected from 1996 through 2009 during long-term fishery-independent monitoring of several estuarine systems along the Gulf and Atlantic coasts of Florida. Indices of abundance and habitat suitability were constructed for gray snapper to determine size-specific relationships between abundance, habitat, and environmental conditions. Juvenile and subadult gray snapper were collected year-round only in the southernmost estuaries but were most common from July through December in all estuaries sampled. In addition to timing of estuarine occupancy, abundance varied with latitude; gray snapper were more frequently collected in warmer, southern estuaries. In general, gray snapper were most abundant in euhaline areas with a high percentage of submerged aquatic vegetation (SAV) and, in most cases, where overhanging shoreline vegetation was also present. Annual abundance varied over the sampling period, with some juvenile peaks in abundance translating to subadult peaks in subsequent years. Although strong correspondence between juvenile and subadult populations was not observed in all systems, long-term, broad-scale habitat selection patterns as described in this study are critical to more effectively assess populations of estuarine-dependent species. © 2013 Coastal and Estuarine Research Federation (outside the USA).},

A stepwise variable selection procedure retained a subset of eight elements that contributed substantially to separating otolith samples, including two rare earth elements; this is one of the first studies in which rare earth elements in otoliths have contributed to separation of fish stocks. The classification success rate in assigning fishes to the correct region of origin was 82%. Resolution of sites less than 10 km apart suggested high site fidelity in juvenile gray snapper and little mixing of water masses between sites.

   abstract = {Fringing mangrove forests and seagrass beds harbor high densities of juvenile snappers and grunts compared to bare substrates, but their occupancy of these habitats is not homogeneous at ecologically meaningful scales, thus limiting our ability to compare habitat value. Here, density and size information were used to determine how gray snapper, <i>Lutjanus griseus</i> (Linnaeus, 1758) and bluestriped grunt, <i>Haemulon sciurus</i> (Shaw, 1803), use vegetated habitats during their ontogeny, and how their use of mangrove forests varied with season across broad spatial scales and physicochemical conditions. Both species exhibited a three-stage ontogenetic strategy: (1) settlement and grow-out (8&#8211;10 mo) within seagrass beds, (2) expansion to mangrove habitats at 10&#8211;12 cm total length, and (3) increasing utilization of inland mangroves during the dry season and with increasing body size. For fishes inhabiting mangroves, multivariate tests revealed that the factors distance from oceanic inlet and water depth were stronger predictors of reef fish utilization than the factors latitude, temperature, or habitat width. These findings highlight that the nursery function of mangrove shorelines is likely limited to the area of immediately accessible habitat, and that more expansive forests may contain a substantial number of larger adult individuals.},

   abstract = {Decline of marine fisheries has become one of the most severe global environmental crises. In typical fishery management efforts, fish populations are often treated as homogeneous units, thereby tacitly ignoring potential intrapopulation variation within taxonomic groupings. We used acoustic telemetry and stable isotope analysis to examine movement patterns of 20 gray snap- per Lutjanus griseus and 20 schoolmaster snapper L. apodus in a Bahamian tidal creek and wetland. In particular, we examined (1) if intrapopulation variation in fish habitat use and movement patterns existed, (2) whether that variation was a function of body size, and (3) if there was evidence of spe- cialization in habitat use among individuals. We found that movement varied substantially among individuals, but was independent of body size. Some individuals exhibited frequent, repeated, move- ments to certain areas of the study site. δ13C values of individual snapper were significantly related to movement metrics, suggesting that movement differences were related to specific patterns of for- aging behavior. Our findings suggest the importance of incorporating intrapopulation niche varia- tion—a source of variation that is often overlooked in traditional conservation and management strategies—into the study of coastal fish populations},

The results provided a quantitative evaluation of the relative contribution of carbon and nitrogen from various primary organic sources to gray snapper taken from each a mangrove and a seagrass dominated location in south Florida. Stomach content analysis revealed that gray snapper from the two areas had similar diets which were primarily composed of penaeid shrimp (>60%). Isotopic results provided a distinction between food webs on the basis of carbon values. The 6'3C of components from the seagrass location were greater than -17%0 in contrast to values of less than - 190/00 for those from the mangrove area. Quantitative estimates indicated that gray snapper from the seagrass area derived more than 90% of their carbon and nitrogen from sediment or water column particulate organic matter. Gray snapper from the mangrove area were supplied by carbon and nitrogen from these sources in addition to detritus. The main contributors appeared to be particulate organic matter from the water column and the brackish water grass, Ruppia maritima. Together, these sources accounted for 35 to 100% of the ultimate source of prey item dietary carbon and nitrogen. These results suggest that within both food webs carbon and nitrogen are transferred from a detrital base by similar mechanisms and emphasize the use of multiple isotopes as a tool for quantitatively evaluating food webs.},

   abstract = {Juvenile gray snapper (Lutjanus griseus) occupy a wide range of estuarine and nearshore habitats that differ in physico-chemical properties. To quantify the energetic cost of inhabiting these different habitats, routine metabolism of individual gray snapper was measured in the laboratory at 20 combinations of temperature (18, 23, 28, and 33°C) and salinity (5, 15, 25, 35, and 45 psu). An open, flow-through respirometer was used, enabling trials to be run for long periods (∼16 h), while maintaining water quality (dissolved O 2>70% saturation), and providing fish sufficient time to habituate to the chambers undisturbed. Video recordings of fish in the respirometer chambers were analyzed to quantify the spontaneous activity rate of individuals. Analysis of covariance, using fish weight and mean activity rate as covariates, indicated significant temperature and salinity effects on oxygen consumption. Oxygen consumption was significantly higher at high salinities, and the salinity effect was temperature dependent. A polynomial equation describing oxygen consumption as a function of temperature and salinity indicated the increase due to salinity from 5 to 45 psu at high temperatures (30-33°C) was equivalent to a 3°C increase in temperature. At intermediate temperatures (24-26°C), the increase due to salinity from 5 to 45 psu was less dramatic, equivalent to a 2°C increase in temperature. At the lowest temperatures (18°C), salinity did not have a significant effect on oxygen consumption. The increased metabolic costs in high salinities (∼7% at the high temperature) represent a significant energy cost for juveniles, that would need to be balanced by lower predation risk or greater food availability to result in similar juvenile production compared to lower salinity environments. © 2005 Elsevier B.V.

Lutjanus griseus diets shifted from dominance by low quality, intertidal crabs upstream to an increased reliance on higher quality shrimp, fishes and benthic crabs downstream. Frequency of L. griseus with empty stomachs was higher at downstream sites. Lutjanus griseus growth rates did not vary among sites. Results indicate that L. griseus may be able to compensate for lower quality prey upstream by consuming more, and thus individuals are able to maintain similar levels of energy balance and growth rates across the estuarine gradient. Elucidating mechanisms, such as compensatory feeding, that enable generalist species to remain successful across habitat conditions are critical to understanding their organismal ecology and may facilitate predictions about the response of generalists to landscape alteration.},

Spawning, settlement, and growth patterns were compared across sites based on otolith microstructure. Larval otolith growth trajectories were generally similar for larvae from different sites and years; however, the mean pelagic larval duration (PLD) was 1 d longer for fish from North Carolina than for fish from the more southern sites. As a result, fish were larger at settlement to North Carolina. Estimated juvenile growth rates ranged between 0.62 and 0.88 mm/d and differed across sites and years, growth being generally faster at the southern sites. Water temperature accounts for some of this variability; however, site-specific differences in other factors probably contributed to some of the observed differences in growth. Back-calculated spawning patterns showed a lunar association with the new and first-quarter moons at all sites except for North Carolina. Settlement patterns were lunar cyclic as well: settlement pulsed during the third-quarter and new moons at all sites, and in North Carolina an additional pulse associated with the full moon was present. Patterns of larval and juvenile growth coupled with recruitment dynamics across the latitudinal gradient are consistent with northward Gulf Stream transport of larvae from southern spawning sites.},

The upsurge in the use of the tool has arisen in part because fisheries managers are now looking to reserves to complement conventional fisheries management techniques. In the United States, the legislative requirement to identify and protect essential fish habitat for managed fisheries species has contributed to the debate over and use of marine protected areas in all their various forms. Information needed to design and implement effective marine protected areas is usually drawn from the fields of fish population dynamics, oceanography, community ecology, and organismal biology, but because the placement, design, and management of marine protected areas are all related to the intended goals, the most crucial information is that about the specific objectives the protected area is designed to achieve. This information is ultimately societal, not scientific. After the spe- cific objectives are elaborated, conservation biology and other sciences can be harnessed to help identify what needs to be protected and in what manner, leading to optimally effective marine protected areas.},

   abstract = {Marine protected areas (MPAs) are a key strategy for mitigating the impacts of fisheries, but their designation can be controversial, and there is uncertainty surrounding when and where MPAs are most effective. Evidence synthesis that collates primary research on MPA effectiveness can provide a crucial bridge between research, policy and practice. However, reviews vary in scope and rigour, meaning decision-makers face the challenge of identifying appropriate reviews. Documenting differences amongst reviews can therefore support nonspecialists in locating the most relevant and rigorous reviews and can also assist researchers in targeting evidence gaps. We addressed these priorities by systematically searching for reviews examining effectiveness of MPAs for biodiversity, critically appraising methods used and categorizing review scope. The 27 reviews assessed overlapped in scope (suggesting some redundancy) and differed substantially in reliability. Key strengths related to the effects of MPAs on fish abundance and the influence of MPA size and age on effectiveness. However, several gaps were noted, with some questions not addressed and others lacking highly reliable syntheses – importantly, the latter may create the perception that particular questions have been adequately addressed, potentially deterring new syntheses. Our findings indicate key aspects of review conduct that could be improved (e.g. documenting critical appraisal of primary research, evaluating potential publication bias) and can facilitate evidence-based policy by guiding nonspecialists to the most reliable and relevant reviews. Lastly, we suggest that future reviews with broader taxonomic coverage and considering the influence of a wider range of MPA characteristics on effectiveness would be beneficial.},

   abstract = {Florida Bay is a large and shallow estuary that is linked to the Everglades watershed and is a target of the Greater Everglades ecosystem restoration effort. The conceptual ecological model presented here is a qualitative and minimal depiction of those ecosystem components and linkages that are considered essential for understanding historic changes in the bay ecosystem, the role of human activities as drivers of these changes, and how restoration efforts are likely to affect the ecosystem in the future. The conceptual model serves as a guide for monitoring and research within an adaptive management framework. Historic changes in Florida Bay that are of primary concern are the occurrence of seagrass mass mortality and subsequent phytoplankton blooms in the 1980s and 1990s. These changes are hypothesized to have been caused by long-term changes in the salinity regime of the bay that were driven by water management. However, historic ecological changes also may have been influenced by other human activities, including occlusion of passes between the Florida Keys and increased nutrient loading. The key to Florida Bay restoration is hypothesized to be seagrass community restoration. This community is the central ecosystem element, providing habitat for upper trophic level species and strongly influencing productivity patterns, sediment resuspension, light penetration, nutrient availability, and phytoplankton dynamics. An expectation of Everglades restoration is that changing patterns of freshwater flow toward more natural patterns will drive Florida Bay's structure and function toward its pre-drainage condition. However, considerable uncertainty exists regarding the indirect effects of changing freshwater flow, particularly with regard to the potential for changing the export of dissolved organic matter from the Everglades and the fate and effects of this nutrient source. Adaptive management of Florida Bay, as an integral part of Everglades restoration, requires an integrated program of monitoring, research to decrease uncertainties, and development of quantitative models (especially hydrodynamic and water quality) to synthesize data, develop and test hypotheses, and improve predictive capabilities. Understanding and quantitatively predicting changes in the nature of watershed-estuarine linkages is the highest priority scientific need for Florida Bay restoration.},

   abstract = {The Lutjanidae (tropical snappers) are important to fisheries throughout the tropics and subtropics. Reliable age-based demographic data are essential for the sustainable management of lutjanid fisheries, and are underpinned by the selection of appropriate ageing structures and validation of increment periodicity within these. Lutjanid age validation has attracted considerable research attention over the past three decades, but lacks a recent synthesis. This paper reviews the four main approaches used in lutjanid age validation; bomb radiocarbon dating, radiometry (lead-radium dating), chemical tagging and marginal increment analysis (MIA). Bomb radiocarbon and lead-radium dating provide absolute age estimates, which can validate increment counts in calcified structures. However, bomb radiocarbon dating cannot accurately age fish older than ~55 years, an age that some lutjanids may meet or exceed. The development of δ14C reference curves for the postbomb decline period offers potential to accurately age fish only a few years old. Technical advances and empirical verification of key assumptions over the last two decades have established the accuracy and validity of lead-radium dating. However, this approach is not uniformly applicable to all study species or areas. Mark-recapture studies using fluorochromes clarify changes in increment appearance and periodicity as fish age, but lutjanid recapture rates are often poor. Marginal increment analysis (MIA) is susceptible to bias and misinterpretation if not rigorously applied. While no single validation approach offers a complete solution, almost all studies support annual increment formation in lutjanid otoliths. Future validation studies would benefit from the development of otolith reference collections and cross-institutional collaboration. Because MIA is inexpensive and logistically simple, its use on lutjanids will inevitably continue, and we therefore provide guidelines for its rigorous application.},

The distribution of International Game Fish Association (IGFA) recreational world records achieved over 70 years (1939-2009) were correlated with the strength and duration of fishery restrictions in MPAs. No difference in record density was detected between coastal areas inside and outside of MPAs where fishing was managed by statewide regulations. However, 74% (n = 143) of all records for three species were concentrated near the two MPAs that had additional fishery restrictions. The highest concentration was along similar to 11% of the mainland coast at Cape Canaveral (CAN) near MPAs closed to all fishing since 1962. It included 42% of spotted seatrout [Cynoscion nebulosus (Cuvier in Cuvier and Valenciennes, 1830)1, 55% of red drum [Sciaenops ocellatus (Linnaeus, 1766)], and 69% of black drum [Pogonias cromis (Linnaeus, 1766)] Florida records. Everglades National Park (ENP) had the second highest concentration with 7% of spotted seatrout, 32% of red drum, and 24% of black drum records caught along similar to 9% of the mainland coast. ENP partially limited fishing starting in 1980 by establishing a closed area, daily bag limits, and eliminating commercial fishing. Common snook [Centropomus undecimalis (Bloch, 1792)] records did not increase significantly at CAN or ENP. Recreational fishery statistics corroborated IGFA record patterns. Total recreational catch and catch per trip (CPUE) increased significantly for spotted seatrout, red drum, and black drum in northeast and southwest Florida, the two regions with the most protective MPAs, and either declined or were unchanged in the northeast and southeast, which did not have MPAs with fishing restrictions. Both datasets supported predictions of marine reserve theory that MPAs can benefit fisheries by increasing the abundance and size of exploited species. Data did not support other alternative hypotheses proposed to explain record patterns. In conclusion, evidence indicates that Florida coastal estuarine MPAs with fishery restrictions allowed recreational anglers to increase their total catch and CPUE, and achieve more game fish world records than would have occurred if all coastal areas had been regulated by existing statewide fishing regulations.},

As a result, fish were larger at settlement to North Carolina. Estimated juvenile growth rates ranged between 0.62 and 0.88 mm/d and differed across sites and years, growth being generally faster at the southern sites. Water temperature accounts for some of this variability; however, site-specific differences in other factors probably contributed to some of the observed differences in growth. Back-calculated spawning patterns showed a lunar association with the new and first-quarter moons at all sites except for North Carolina. Settlement patterns were lunar cyclic as well: settlement pulsed during the third-quarter and new moons at all sites, and in North Carolina an additional pulse associated with the full moon was present. Patterns of larval and juvenile growth coupled with recruitment dynamics across the latitudinal gradient are consistent with northward Gulf Stream transport of larvae from southern spawning sites.},

   abstract = {Management strategy evaluation (MSE) involves using simulation to compare the relative effectiveness for achieving management objectives of different combinations of data collection schemes, methods of analysis and subsequent processes leading to management actions. MSE can be used to identify a ‘best’ management strategy among a set of candidate strategies, or to determine how well an existing strategy performs. The ability of MSE to facilitate fisheries management achieving its aims depends on how well uncertainty is represented, and how effectively the results of simulations are summarized and presented to the decision-makers. Key challenges for effective use of MSE therefore include characterizing objectives and uncertainty, assigning plausibility ranks to the trials considered, and working with decision- makers to interpret and implement the results of the MSE. This paper explores how MSEs are conducted and characterizes current ‘best practice’ guidelines, while also indicating whether and how these best practices were applied to two case- studies: the Bering–Chukchi–Beaufort Seas bowhead whales (Balaena mysticetus; Balaenidae) and the northern subpopulation of Pacific sardine (Sardinops sagax caerulea; Clupeidae).},

   abstract = {The sampling efficiencies of commercial standard fish traps and baited remote underwater stereo-video systems (stereo-BRUVs) were compared by examining the diversity and relative abundance of tropical demersal fish that each method sampled on the north-western shelf (40-60. m) of Western Australia. Stereo-BRUVs recorded many more species (91 species from 32 families) than commercial fish traps (30 species and 15 families). Stereo-BRUVs also sampled many more individuals (mean 36.55 ± 5.91 SE) than fish traps (mean 12.30 ± 1.40 SE). This suggests stereo-BRUVs would be more capable of detecting changes in the relative abundance of species over time. Data from four commercially important species (Epinephelus bilobatus, Epinephelus multinotatus, Lethrinus punctulatus and Lutjanus russelli) revealed that stereo-BRUVs had much greater statistical power to detect change than an equivalent number of samples from fish traps. In contrast, fish traps had a greater statistical power to detect change for a fifth target species, Lutjanus sebae. For two commonly sampled species, Abalistes stellatus 11Usage follows CAABcodes (Rees, A.J.J., Yearsley, G.K., Gowlett-Holmes, K. and Pogonoski, J.

Available at: http://www.cmar.csiro.au/caab/.). and Lethrinus punctulatus, stereo-BRUVs sampled a smaller mean length than fish traps while for a third species, Lutjanus sebae, stereo-BRUVs recorded a larger mean length. The length frequencies for these species were not significantly different between methods, although stereo-BRUVs sampled a much larger range of lengths than was captured in traps. This study demonstrates that stereo-BRUVs are potentially a much more powerful technique than fish traps for assessing species richness, relative abundance and size structure in multi-species fisheries in north-western Australia. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

   abstract = {The protection of species requires an understanding of their habitat requirements and how habitat characteristics affect their distribution, survival and growth. This need is espe- cially important in areas where anthropogenic pressures can not only have a significant direct impact on the survival of the species but also damage their habitat. The Firth of Clyde in south- western Scotland was an important commercial fishing area for a variety of demersal fish species up until 1973. However, stocks rapidly declined thereafter and the catch of targeted species ceased in 2005, despite fisheries measures put in place to aid recovery. Changes in the availability and quality of fish habitat are possible explanations for this lack of recovery. Here, we report on stereo baited remote underwater video surveys in the Firth of Clyde between June and September in 2013 and 2014 to determine the habitat of juvenile Atlantic cod Gadus morhua, haddock Melanogrammus aeglefinus and whiting Merlangius merlangus. Habitat predictor variables explored included substratum type, depth, wave fetch, and epibenthic and demersal fauna diver- sity. G. morhua were most abundant in shallow, sheltered areas composed of gravel−pebble con- taining maerl. M. aeglefinus and M. merlangus predominated over deeper sand and mud. Onto- genetic shifts in all 3 species were also observed. Relative abundances of G. morhua and M. merlangus were positively related to the diversity of epibenthic and demersal fauna. Our results indicate that spatial conservation measures to benefit demersal fish should be advised by patterns of epibenthic and demersal fauna diversity as well as physical substratum types. KEY},

The A. thazard was found to record significantly (P < 0·05) higher species richness and number of carnivorous fishes than plant-based baits, while abundance of herbivores was maximum in raw dough-turmeric powder mix trials. There was also a significant difference in trophic composition of fish assemblages surveyed by animal- and plant-based baits which seemed to be due to variations in attraction patterns of carnivores and herbivores occurring at the earlier phases of each BRUV deployments. Meanwhile, the assemblage structure was comparable among fish assemblages sampled by different bait treatments, indicating that species-level responses to each bait type may be more complicated. In essence, the efficiency of mixed baits should also be examined in future studies.},

   abstract = {Baited underwater cameras are becoming a popular tool to monitor fish and invertebrate populations within protected and inshore environments where trawl surveys are unsuitable. Modelling the arrival times of deep-sea grenadiers using an inverse square relationship has enabled abundance estimates, comparable to those from bottom trawl surveys, to be gathered from deep-sea baited camera surveys. Baited underwater camera systems in the shallow water environments are however, currently limited to relative comparisons of assemblages based on simple metrics such as Max<inf>N</inf> (maximum number of fish seen at any one time). This study describes a stochastic simulation approach used to model the behaviour of fish and invertebrates around a BUC system to enable absolute abundance estimates to be generated from arrival patterns. Species-specific models were developed for the tropical reef fishes the black tip grouper (Epinephelus fasciatus) and moray eel (Gymnothorax spp.) and the Antarctic scavengers; the asteroid (Odontaster validus) and the nemertean worm (Parbolasia corrugatus). A sensitivity analysis explored the impact of input parameters on the arrival patterns (Max<inf>N</inf>, time to the arrival of the first individual and the time to reach Max<inf>N</inf>) for each species generated by the model. Sensitivity analysis showed a particularly strong link between Max<inf>N</inf> and abundance indicating that this model could be used to generate absolute abundances from existing or future Max<inf>N</inf> data. It in effect allows the slope of the Max<inf>N</inf> vs. abundance relationship to be estimated. Arrival patterns generated by each model were used to estimate population abundance for the focal species and these estimates were compared to data from underwater visual census transects. Using a Bland-Altman analysis, baited underwater camera data processed using this model were shown to generate absolute abundance estimates that were comparable to underwater visual census data.},

The system's high-quality video stream and images, together with its camera capacity (up to nine cameras), permit in situ observations of shrimp feeding behavior, shrimp size and internal anatomy, and organic matter residues on pond sediments. The UVS can operate continuously and be focused remotely, a convenience to shrimp farmers. The observations possible with the UVS provide aquaculturists with information critical to provision of feed with minimal waste; determining whether the accumulation of organic-matter residues dictates exchange of pond water; and management decisions concerning shrimp health.},

   abstract = {Baited remote underwater video systems are becoming a widely adopted tool for sampling fish assemblages. One of the outstanding knowledge gaps associated with this technique is the effect of different quantities of bait on the fish assemblages sampled. We investigated how different quantities of bait (0. g, 200. g, 1000. g or 2000. g of crushed pilchards, Sardinops sagax) influenced the relative abundance and species richness of a temperate, Western Australian reef fish assemblage sampled with baited remote underwater stereo-video systems (stereo-BRUVs). The presence of bait significantly increased the relative abundance and numbers of fish species sampled, with few differences between the three quantities of bait. Trends in fork length were identified between bait quantities for some species. For example, juvenile stage Coris auricularis (a protogynous labrid) were significantly larger in the unbaited treatment, whereas males of the same species were significantly smaller at unbaited treatments. This pattern was interpreted as being the result of intraspecific competition and the dominance of larger males in the presence of bait. When bait was present, fish were significantly closer to the stereo-BRUVs. However, there was again no difference between the three baited treatments. At this location in temperate Western Australia, stereo-BRUVs with 200. g of bait are as effective at sampling the temperate reef fish assemblage as stereo-BRUVs set with greater quantities of bait. In our study, the numbers of high trophic level species recorded were low. In areas with abundant high trophic level fishes, such as tropical reef systems, greater quantities of bait may be required to prevent it being quickly depleted by intense feeding. © 2013 .},

   abstract = {Nature reserves are created to conserve biodiversity and restore populations of harvested species, but it is not clear whether this strategy is successful in all ecosystems. Reserves are gazetted in estuaries to offset impacts from burgeoning human populations, however, coastal conservation cannot be optimized because their effectiveness is rarely evaluated. We surveyed 220 sites in 22 estuaries in the Moreton Bay Marine Park, Queensland, Australia, including all six current estuarine marine reserves within the park. Fishes were surveyed using one hour deployments of baited remote underwater video stations twice at each site over consecutive days. We show that although the estuarine reserves in Moreton Bay contain a significantly different fish community, they fail to enhance the abundance of harvested fish species. We posit that performance is limited because reserves protect unique spatial features, or conserve narrow estuaries with weak connections to mangrove habitats and the open sea. Consequently, reserves as currently positioned protect only a subset of potential environmental conditions present for fish within the region, and potentially support residual estuarine habitats (i.e. expansive intertidal flats or shallow creeks) which are not particularly significant to either fish or fishers. We argue that reserve effectiveness can be improved by conserving deeper estuaries, with diverse habitats for fish and strong connections to the open sea. Without incorporating these critical spatial considerations into estuarine reserve design, estuarine reserves are doomed to fail.},

   abstract = {There remains limited knowledge of how offshore windfarm developments influence fish assemblages, particularly at a local scale around the turbine structures. Considering the existing levels of anthropogenic pressures on coastal fish populations it is becoming increasingly important for developers and environmental regulators to gain a more comprehensive understanding of the factors influencing fish assemblages. Improving our ability to assess such fish populations in close proximity to structures will assist in increasing this knowledge. In the present study we provide the first trial use of Baited Remote Underwater Stereo-Video systems (stereo BRUVs) for the quantification of motile fauna in close proximity to offshore wind turbines. The study was conducted in the Irish Sea and finds the technique to be a viable means of assessing the motile fauna of such environments. The present study found a mixture of species including bottom dwellers, motile crustaceans and large predatory fish. The majority of taxa observed were found to be immature individuals with few adult individuals recorded. The most abundant species were the angular crab (Goneplax rhomboides) and the small-spotted catshark (Scyliorhinus canicula). Of note in this study was the generally low abundance and diversity of taxa recorded across all samples, we hypothesise that this reflects the generally poor state of the local fauna of the Irish Sea. The faunal assemblages sampled in close proximity to turbines were observed to alter with increasing distance from the structure, species more characteristic of hard bottom environments were in abundance at the turbines (e.g. Homarus gammarus, Cancer pagarus, Scyliorhinus spp.) and those further away more characteristic of soft bottoms (e.g. Norwegian Lobster). This study highlights the need for the environmental impacts of offshore renewables on motile fauna to be assessed using targeted and appropriate tools. Stereo BRUVs provide one of those tools, but like the majority of methods for sampling marine biota, they have limitations. We conclude our paper by providing a discussion of the benefits and limitations of using this BRUV technique for assessing fauna within areas close to offshore windfarms.},

Baited remote underwater stereo-video (stereo-BRUV) systems can provide fishery independent information on the biases and selectivity of particular fishing gears in relation to the length distribution of what is potentially available for capture. In the tropical demersal fishery off northwestern Australia the length distributions of 12 species sampled by standard commercial fish traps and stereo-BRUVs were compared using kernel density estimation techniques. We found no significant differences in the shape of the length distributions sampled by either method. However, the location (mean length) of the length distribution of seven of the 11 target species and the one bycatch species differed between the sampling methods. A family-specific trend was exhibited, likely due to the ambush behaviour of larger epinephelids in traps and the saturation of the field of view of stereo-BRUV by schools of smaller lutjanids. However, the difference in mean length was not biologically significant for these families. These results indicate that samples of target species derived from commercial trap catches are likely to provide representative and robust estimates of vital population statistics and life history parameters.},

Comparisons of stereo baited remote underwater video (stereo-BRUV) and stereo-towed video, a new and rela- tively un common methodology of assessing fish assemblages, were made for assessing fish assem- blages beyond diveable depths (>30 m). Stereo-BRUV and towed video footage were analysed for species composition and functional feeding groups in structure-forming macroalgae and sponge- dominated benthic habitats in temperate waters off Warrnambool, Victoria, Australia. Multibeam echosounder (MBES) data, light attenuation and temperature recordings were gathered for each deployment in order to characterise the seafloor structure and oceanographic parameters at each stereo-BRUV location and towed transect. A more abundant and diverse fish assemblage was ob - served in stereo-BRUV compared to towed video. The fish assemblage observed using the 2 meth- ods was relatively similar in canopy forming algae habitat, but clearly distinct in sponge habitats. Power analysis also showed stereo-BRUV to have greater statistical power when observing total individuals, species richness and functional group richness across both habitats, with the excep- tion of functional group richness in the sponge habitat. Stereo-BRUVs observed higher abun- dances of elasmobranches, Meuschenia spp., snapper Chrysophrys auratus, demersal invertivores and pelagic planktivores, whilst towed video observed more cryptic and territorial species such as Olisthops cyanomelas and Pempheris multiradiata. Using a combination of stereo baited and towed video sampling techniques records a more detailed description of the fish assemblage on temperate reefs than using either method alone.},

   abstract = {Baited remote underwater stereo-video (stereo-BRUV) stations and diver operated stereo-video (stereo-DOV) transects are increasingly used to sample both tropical and temperate fish assemblages. Compared to in situ visual census methods, the use of stereo-video reduces inter-observer variability, improves definition of the sample unit area, increases accuracy of fish length estimates and provides a permanent record of the assemblage that can be validated where required or independently reanalysed. Previous studies have suggested that stereo-BRUV collects representative data on both carnivorous and herbivorous species and can be more cost-efficient than diver-based survey methods. This study compares estimates of common fish assemblage metrics obtained with stereo-BRUV stations and stereo-DOV transects across 3 biogeographic regions, and uses a cost-optimization procedure to compare the efficiency of these 2 methods. Stereo-BRUV stations were found to sample greater species richness and obtain greater estimates of relative biomass of generalist carnivores, but no differences occurred in the biomass of herbivores sampled by the 2 techniques. Stereo-BRUV stations generally obtained estimates of assemblage metrics with less variance, resulting in greater power to detect spatial and temporal changes in the fish assemblage metrics. Cost benefit analyses found that stereo-BRUV was generally more time efficient than stereo-DOV transects in terms of smaller standard error around the mean of the various metrics considered. However, across the 3 biogeographic regions sampled there was considerable variation in the magnitude of these differences. Results suggest that stereo-BRUV stations are, in general, a more cost-effective method for monitoring fish assemblages than stereo-DOV transects.},

   abstract = {Candidate indicators of the direct and indirect effects of fishing can be developed by investigating fisheries closures. We tested a suite of such indicators in areas open to fishing but with suspected differences in effort, using baited remote underwater stereo-video methods. In particular, we predicted that greater fishing would result in decreased biomass of high risk target species and indirectly increase the biomass of small-bodied non-target species. As predicted, the biomass of target species was found to be greater in areas of lower fishing effort and in deeper waters. However, no indirect effects of fishing were detected and any community-level effects were driven by differences in the biomass of target species. In particular, assemblage length class analysis of covariance (ANCOVA), size spectra analysis and the abundance-biomass comparison (ABC) method did not provide any evidence of indirect effects of fishing. The magnitude of the differences in fishing effort between the two areas sampled, may be sufficient to significantly affect target fisheries species, but insufficient to lead to indirect effects on non-target populations. It is also possible that the predicted indirect effects do not occur in this assemblage, due to weak trophic linkages between species. Differences observed using the ABC method were attributed to variation in the abundance of large herbivorous fishes, which are not fished. We also found assemblage length class ANCOVA and size spectra to be insensitive to the direct effects of fishing where large numbers of non-target individuals are sampled along with fished species. We suggest diet studies and comparisons across stronger gradients in fishing pressure to further investigate the indirect effects of fishing in this assemblage. ?? 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

   abstract = {Underwater video techniques are increasingly used in marine ecology studies. Technological progress regarding video cameras, sensors (such as sounders), battery life and information storage make these techniques now accessible to a majority of users. However, diver-based underwater visual censuses, and catch and effort data, remain the most commonly used for observing coastal biodiversity and species. In this paper, we review the underwater video techniques that have been developed since the 1950s to investigate and/or monitor coastal biodiversity. Techniques such as remote underwater video, whether baited or not, diver-operated video and towed video are described, along with corresponding applications in the field. We then analyse the complementary of techniques, first from studies comparing video techniques with other observation techniques, whether video-based or not, and second by documenting their respective cost efficiencies. These findings are discussed with respect to current challenges in monitoring and investigating coastal biodiversity. Video should be more often considered and used, either in addition to or as an alternative to diver-based, fishing and acoustic techniques, as it may be particularly suited for monitoring coastal biodiversity in a variety of areas and on larger scales than hitherto and within an ecosystem-based approach to management and conservation. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

   abstract = {Monitoring strategies which adequately represent the entire community associated with artificial structures will enable more informed decisions regarding the broader effects of artificial structures and their role in the management of fisheries resources. Despite the widespread application of a range of in situ visual monitoring methodologies used in the assessment of artificial structures, the relative biases associated with each method have not been critically examined and remain poorly understood. Estimates of fish abundance on six estuarine artificial reefs carried out by divers using underwater visual census techniques (UVC) were compared with estimates of relative abundance determined by baited remote underwater video (BRUV). It was found that when combined, both methods provided a more comprehensive description of the species associated with estuarine artificial reefs. However, the difference in the number of species detected and the frequency of detection varied between methods. Results indicated that the differences in rates of detection between UVC and BRUV methodologies were primarily related to the ecological niche and behaviour of the species in question. UVC provided better estimates of the rare or cryptic reef associated species. BRUV sampled a smaller proportion of species overall but did identify key recreational species such as Acanthopagrus australis, Pagrus auratus and Rhabdosargus sarba with increased frequency. Correlation of abundance indices for species classified as "permanent" identified interspecific interactions that may act as a source of bias associated with BRUV observations.},

The study is based on data collected as part of a long-term monitoring program in the Tsitsikamma National Park marine protected area, South Africa. As a test scenario, declining population trajectories of the most abundant species, Chrysoblephus laticeps, were simulated by introducing consecutive years of reduced recruitment over periods of 10 and 20 years applying an age-structured operating model. The operating model was designed to generate method-specific relative abundance indices and length-frequency data, using parameters derived from existing data collected in the long-term monitoring program. These were then fitted with an age-structured estimation model. Estimated spawner-biomass depletion was compared to the 'true' simulated population to quantify method-specific accuracy and bias using root-mean-squared error. Due to higher data variability and inherent size selectivity of angling, stereo-BRUVs provided more accurate spawner-biomass trends when describing a distinct population decline over 10 and 20 years. Additionally, spawner-biomass was found to be a more accurate population estimate than relative abundance indices due to the inclusion of population size structure information. The study demonstrates the potential of using simulation testing to evaluate sampling methods, given that the process generates the 'true' population with a known abundance and size structure.},

   abstract = {Fish communities associated with a series of artificial reefs deployed in three estuaries in southeastern Australia (151° 34' E, 33° 7' S to 150° 37' E, 35° 8' S) were surveyed using both Baited Remote Underwater Video (BRUV) and Underwater Visual Census (UVC). Abundance estimates, frequency of observations, and species indicators (richness and diversity) provided the basis for comparison between methods. UVC recorded significantly greater numbers of species in all estuaries and significantly greater species richness and diversity at two of the three estuaries. Variation in the number and frequency of species detected by each method directly related to the ecological niche and behaviour of each species. UVC provided better estimates of the rare or cryptic reef associated species. BRUV sampled a smaller proportion of species overall but did observe key recreational species such as Acanthopagrus australis, Pagrus auratus and Rhabdosargus sarba with increased frequency, although the presence of large numbers of schooling species such as Pelates sexlineatus reduced the detection frequency of these species. In summary, results indicate that BRUV is an effective method for recording species associated with artificial reefs with the exception of cryptic species that are located within the reef structure itself. BRUV techniques complement UVC by providing increased coverage of species known to be diver averse as well as providing important information regarding behaviour of the species identified. Given the limitation of each method, it is recommended that monitoring plans for artificial structures should adopt a multi-method approach utilising BRUV and UVC where possible. © 2012 .},

   abstract = {Despite calls for networks of no-take sanctuary zones of 'moderate size' (10-100km<sup>2</sup>) to meet both conservation and resource management objectives, there have been a plethora of small (1-5km<sup>2</sup>) and very small (<1km<sup>2</sup>) no-take areas created in the last decade globally. For example, the temperate eastern Indian Ocean has a range of small to very small no-take marine areas. The current study focused on the Rottnest Island Marine Reserve off the coast of Western Australia, containing the oldest and largest no-take sanctuary zone in the region (1.6km<sup>2</sup>, established in 1988) and three newly created no-take sanctuary zones (0.8-0.9km<sup>2</sup>, established in 2007). Three years of transect and baited video monitoring data (2009-2011) from the four no-take areas were compared inside and outside of the sanctuary zones and to previously published studies of the oldest sanctuary zone. Throughout the three-year study, greater size-structure and biomass of two small-bodied by-catch wrasse species were observed in the oldest sanctuary zone, consistent with previously published studies. In contrast to previously published studies from Rottnest, no consistent differences were observed in any large bodied fished species within the oldest sanctuary zone and no increases in biomass were observed in the newly created no-take areas. The results suggest that small sanctuary zones do not provide consistent protection for larger-bodied fished species, but can for smaller-bodied by-catch species. The generality of these results is limited by the lack of replication due to only one established no-take area in the region, and the large proportion of sand habitats which limited the number of sampling sites for reef fishes within the sanctuaries. However, the results suggest that if consistent protection of large-bodied fisheries species is an objective of no-take areas, representative and replicated sanctuary zones should be of greater size and encompass a greater range of depths and habitats. Such systems will also provide the necessary spatial replication between and within no-take areas to design robust monitoring programs to inform conservation management.},

Optimizing inference from survey data is dependent upon understanding the extent of sampling bias, which is inevitable when a subsample is taken to represent the entire population. In this study, angling is compared to Baited Remote Underwater Stereo-Video systems (stereo-BRUVs) as fisheries-independent sampling techniques for surveying temperate reef fishes in the Tsitsikamma Marine Protected Area, South Africa. The comparison highlighted a number of differences in the observed ichthyofauna, notably the ability of stereo-BRUVs to sample a wider range of species while also providing a more consistent index of relative abundance. Comparing relative abundance estimates indicated that both sampling methods were, in general, detecting similar environmentally-induced trends. Size distribution data from the two methods differed significantly amongst the predominant species, and angling produced consistently larger length-frequencies than stereo-BRUVs. However, when the hook-based size selectivity of angling was taken into account, there were no significant differences between the two methods. The ability to detect a species-specific population change over a period of five years was assessed using power analyses, and stereo-BRUVs consistently outperformed angling. The results identify stereo-BRUVs as the superior technique for monitoring the population and size-structure of temperate reef fishes.},

A variety of approaches have been developed to enumerate fish on videos, but to our knowledge these metrics have not been tested to determine if they are proportional to true abundance. We compared the most commonly used metric, MaxN (i.e., the maximum number of fish in a single frame during the viewing interval), to a newly developed metric, MeanCount (i.e., the mean number of fish observed in a series of snapshots over a viewing interval), using simulations, a laboratory experiment, and an empirical study. MaxN was nonlinearly related to true abundance using all three approaches, providing increasingly dampened estimates of abundance with increasing true abundance (i.e., hyperstability). Therefore, MaxN may result in positively biased indices of abundance for declining fish stocks or negatively biased abundance indices when fish stocks are increasing. Alternatively, MeanCount was generally linearly related to true abundance and its variability was similar to MaxN, suggesting that MeanCount can be useful for indexing abundance of fish in underwater video surveys.},

Digital video technology is rapidly improving, and it is now possible to record long periods of high resolution digital imagery cost effectively, making single or stereo-video systems one of the primary sampling tools. However, manual species identification, counting, and measuring of fish in stereo-video images is labour intensive and is the major disincentive against the uptake of this technology. Automating species identification using technologies developed by researchers in computer vision and machine learning would transform marine science. In this article, a new paradigm of image set classification is presented that can be used to achieve improved recognition rates for a number of fish species. State-of-the-art image set construction, modelling, and matching algorithms from computer vision literature are discussed with an analysis of their application for automatic fish species identification. It is demonstrated that these algorithms have the potential of solving the automatic fish species identification problem in underwater videos captured within unconstrained environments.},

Depending on research objectives, both image acquisition and analysis procedures may indeed differ.

This led to the conception of a new software: AVIExplore. Its general architecture and its three constitutive modules: AVIExplore — Mobile, AVIExplore — Fixed and AVIExplore — ScriptEdit are presented.

Its main features include: (1) image selection tools allowing for the division of videos in homogeneous sections, (2) automatic extraction of targeted information, (3) solutions for long-term time-series as well as large spatial scale image acquisition, (4) real time acquisition and in some cases real time analysis, and (5) a large range of customized image-analysis possibilities through a script editor. The flexibility of use of AVIExplore is illustrated and validated by three case studies: (1) coral identification and mapping, (2) identification and quantification of different types of behaviors in a mud shrimp, and (3) quantification of filtering activity in a passive suspension-feeder. The accuracy of the software is measured comparing with visual assessment. It is: 90.2%, 82.7%, and 98.3% for the three case studies, respectively. Some of the advantages and current limitations of the software as well as some of its foreseen advancements are then briefly discussed.},

The recent development of baited remote underwater video systems (BRUVs) provide an alternative quantitative sampling method. Despite being used in warmer temperate and tropical waters and cool-temperate waters in Victoria, initial trials of vertical BRUVs in Tasmania, Australia, provided poor results. Our study explored possible reasons for this, including using horizontal BRUVs and various baits across a depth gradient. We examined the fish fauna in, and adjacent to, a small, but long-established, no-take marine reserve to assess the potential for BRUVs to enhance monitoring programs in exposed coastal environments. Significant differences in the fish assemblage were described relating to location, depth and bait type, with pilchards being an effective bait type. Fish abundance and species richness increased with depth. The research validated BRUVs for monitoring deep-reef systems in Tasmania, reinforced the importance of depth in structuring fish assemblages and identified the range of observable species in this region that may not be fully captured with diver-based surveys alone. Power analyses were conducted using the data generated here to inform the amount of replication needed to detect biologically meaningful differences in targeted fish assemblages in subsequent studies examining the response of no-take marine reserves to protection. This facilitates future assessments of the effectiveness of Tasmanian no-take reserves and allows for more broad-scale studies that can address a range of ecological and conservation questions.},

Baited remote underwater video (BRUV) can be used to quantify estuarine species, but BRUV-derived data may be confounded by variable bait plume area and the associated effect on relative sampling effort. This study investigated the potential effects of current velocity on estuarine fish abundance data, and whether associated changes in bait plume size are important for benthic BRUV surveys in estuaries. BRUV sampling was conducted across two zones in two adjacent estuaries, and current velocity measured with a drogue during each BRUV deployment. Current velocity ranged from 0.02 to 0.65ms-1, resulting in potential bait plume areas that varied by orders of magnitude. The maximum number of each species (MaxN) was processed to produce a standardised (by bait plume area) and unstandardised multivariate species data set. The two data sets, whilst developed from identical video footage, yielded contrasting results. Unstandardised data was more variable, but produced a stronger correlation between abiotic variables and community structure. In addition, repeated sampling at some sites revealed significant temporal variance in community structure when data was standardised by bait plume area. Variability in sampling effort resulting from variable current velocity and associated bait plume area may confound interpretation of BRUV data. © 2013.},

This non-destructive and cost-effective technique is increasingly used for assessing estuarine, coastal and marine fauna. Although single camera systems have been used to assess the relative abundance (Nmax) of marine fish and invertebrates in low visibility North Atlantic near shore and coastal waters, stereo systems remain in their infancy within such environments and their use requires validation. Stereo systems that measure fish and invertebrate size enable size-frequency analysis of populations, providing critical information about life history and population status. We investigated the performance and efficacy of stereo BRUV systems within Welsh shallow coastal waters to test the effectiveness of this method. Data are presented on the capacity of the system to measure fish and invertebrate size under the constraints of low visibility (<2m). We also present data on the required duration of deployment required to effectively sample relative fish abundance and diversity. Our study recorded 19 species of mobile fauna with species-time accumulation curves providing evidence that a minimum deployment time of 1h is required to sample 66% of the fish species, and 2h to sample 83%. Results suggest that the efficiency of surveys for target species (e.g. gadoids) could be maximised by modifying the sampling duration between 1h and 2h. The study also demonstrates that measurements of fish and invertebrate length could be taken on 41% of individuals (of those counted in relative abundance measures using Nmax), a statistic that varies between species. This indicates a need to modify the construction of the equipment for improved fish assemblage size frequency analysis. This is particularly relevant in areas and habitats where seine netting and trawling are not possible. We describe how the system can be modified for optimised usage within low visibility waters and suggest potential uses of the system.},

New methods are necessary to investigate reef communities at greater spatial and temporal scales. We examined fish densities derived by concurrent diver and acoustic surveys on a series of linear relict reef lines in southeastern Florida, USA. Fish density estimates displayed differences in magnitude, but similar patterns across independent sampling units. Estimates of fish lengths derived by both methods suggest that a seasonal increase in size occurred across the surveyed reefs. The efficacy of diver-based surveys declined with increasing visibility, while acoustic survey results remained insensitive to changes in water column visibility. Results between survey methods correlate statistically, suggesting that studies may utilize combined methods to investigate fish density distributions on large spatial scales not typically examined.},

In the present study we investigate the role of seagrass in supporting juvenile fish of commercial value. By assessing seagrass relative to adjacent sand we determined the presence of abundant juvenile fish. Nine commercial species were recorded and the most abundant of these were Plaice, Pollock and Herring. We provide the first quantitative evidence of the presence of juvenile fish of commercial value in seagrass surrounding Great Britain. Although the species that we found in seagrass as juveniles are not obligate seagrass users the resources that seagrass meadows offer to these fish provide significant long-term fitness benefits, potentially enhancing the whole population. ?? 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

At multiple locations, we examined the hypothesis that diversity and abundance in temperate reef fish assemblages were independent of bait type. We used 3 bait types (abalone viscera, pilchards and crushed urchin) and quantified commonly used metrics for the fish assemblage, including species richness, time of first arrival and relative abundance on 3 shallow rocky reefs in southeastern Australia over 2 yr. We distinguished the following 6 feeding guilds: herbivore, zooplanktivore, alga/inverte- brate consumers, invertebrate carnivore, macroinvertebrate carnivore and generalist carnivore. The response of fishes was dependent on bait type, with urchin bait performing particularly poorly. Although we did not detect statistical differences between the performance of pilchards and abalone viscera as bait, pilchards produced more consistent outcomes. Importantly, we also observed strong spatial effects. In general, bait type had a marked effect on species richness, but little influence on relative abundance. Overall we conclude that oily bait such as pilchards, which have been widely used in most studies, yield the most consistent outcomes. Consequently, bait type and spatial variation in fish assemblages needs to be considered in sampling designs to assess the limitations of BRUVS},

   abstract = {Habitat degradation and fishing are major drivers of temporal and spatial changes in fish communities. The independent effects of these drivers are well documented, but the relative importance and interaction between fishing and habitat shifts is poorly understood, particularly in complex systems such as coral reefs. To assess the combined and relative effects of fishing and habitat we examined the composition of fish communities on patch reefs across a gradient of high to low structural complexity in fished and unfished areas of the Ningaloo Marine Park, Western Australia. Biomass and species richness of fish were positively correlated with structural complexity of reefs and negatively related to macroalgal cover. Total abundance of fish was also positively related to structural complexity, however this relationship was stronger on fished reefs than those where fishing is prohibited. The interaction between habitat condition and fishing pressure is primarily due to the high abundance of small bodied planktivorous fish on fished reefs. However, the influence of management zones on the abundance and biomass of predators and target species is small, implying spatial differences in fishing pressure are low and unlikely to be driving this interaction. Our results emphasise the importance of habitat in structuring reef fish communities on coral reefs especially when gradients in fishing pressure are low. The influence of fishing effort on this relationship may however become more important as fishing pressure increases. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

   abstract = {Fish surveys form the backbone of reef monitoring and management initiatives throughout the tropics, and understanding patterns in biases between techniques is crucial if outputs are to address key objectives optimally. Often biases are not consistent across natural environmental gradients such as depth, leading to uncertainty in interpretation of results. Recently there has been much interest in mesophotic reefs (reefs from 30–150 m depth) as refuge habitats from fishing pressure, leading to many comparisons of reef fish communi-ties over depth gradients. Here we compare fish communities using stereo-video footage recorded via baited remote underwater video (BRUV) and diver-operated video (DOV) sys-tems on shallow and mesophotic reefs in the Mesoamerican Barrier Reef, Caribbean. We show inconsistent responses across families, species and trophic groups between methods across the depth gradient. Fish species and family richness were higher using BRUV at both depth ranges, suggesting that BRUV is more appropriate for recording all components of the fish community. Fish length distributions were not different between methods on shallow reefs, yet BRUV recorded more small fish on mesophotic reefs. However, DOV consistently recorded greater relative fish community biomass of herbivores, suggesting that studies focusing on herbivores should consider using DOV. Our results highlight the importance of considering what component of reef fish community researchers and managers are most interested in surveying when deciding which survey technique to use across natural gradi-ents such as depth.},

We used 77 simultaneous multi-gear deployments to make inferences about relative abundance, diversity, length composition, and habitat of the reef fish community along the southeastern US Atlantic coast. In total, 117 taxa were observed by underwater visual census (UVC), stationary video, and chevron fish traps, with more taxa being observed by UVC (100) than video (82) or traps (20). Frequency of occurrence of focal species was similar among all sampling approaches for tomtate Haemulon aurolineatum and black sea bass Centropristis striata, higher for UVC and video compared to traps for red snapper Lutjanus campechanus, vermilion snapper Rhomboplites aurorubens, and gray triggerfish Balistes capriscus, and higher for UVC compared to video or traps for gray snapper L. griseus and lionfish Pterois spp. For 6 of 7 focal spe- cies, correlations of relative abundance among gears were strongest between UVC and video, but there was substantial variability among species. The number of recorded species between UVC and video was correlated (ρ = 0.59), but relationships between traps and the other 2 methods were weaker. Lengths of fish visually estimated by UVC were similar to lengths of fish caught in traps, as were habitat characterizations from UVC and video. No gear provided a complete census for any species in our study, suggesting that analytical methods accounting for imperfect detection are necessary to make unbiased inferences about fish abundance.},

In this work, fish assemblages associated with the “outer” and “inner” sides of four marinas, two at the Canary Islands and two at southern Portugal, were investigated using three complementary sampling techniques: underwater visual censuses (UVCs), baited cameras (BCs), and fish traps (FTs). We firstly investigated the complementarity of these sampling methods to describe species composition. Then, we investigated differences in taxonomic (TD), phylogenetic (PD) and functional diversity (FD) between sides of the marinas according to each sampling method. Finally, we explored the applicability/reproducibility of each sampling technique to characterize fish assemblages according to these metrics of diversity. UVCs and BCs provided complementary information, in terms of the number and abundances of species, while FTs sampled a particular assemblage. Patterns of TD, PD, and FD between sides of the marinas varied depending on the sampling method. UVC was the most cost-efficient technique, in terms of personnel hours, and it is recommended for local studies. However, for large-scale studies, BCs are recommended, as it covers greater spatio-temporal scales by a lower cost. Our study highlights the need to implement complementary sampling techniques to monitor ecological change, at various dimensions of biodiversity. The results presented here will be useful for optimizing future monitoring programs.},

Most marine ecologists are not experts in underwater photogrammetry and are not necessarily aware of some of the key design and implementation issues that influence the accuracy and precision of the measurements. Two factors that can influence the measurement accuracy and precision of a stereo-video system are the calibration strategy and the physical orientation of the system. We compare the accuracy and precision of length measurements made by systems calibrated using two regularly used calibration approaches. We also compare length measurements recorded from cameras with base separations of 150 mm, 400 mm, and 800 mm. A three-dimensional (3D), network calibration method using a purpose built calibration cube was used to determine key calibration and camera orientation parameters (e.g., base separation, focal length, and lens distortions) with much improved precision in comparison to a two-dimensional method using either an A3 or A4 planar calibration pattern. As a result, measurements made with a 3D cube displayed improved accuracy and precision compared to either the A3 or A4 planar calibration pattern across a range of typical operational distances. The distance between the cameras on the base bar (base separation) affects the accuracy and precision of measurements with the 800 mm system producing length estimates of improved accuracy and precision than the systems with narrower baselines. The 150 mm system resulted in measurements with poor precision and accuracy, especially for measurements made at distances greater than six meters.},

   abstract = { Baited remote underwater video (BRUV) has been identified in the literature as a powerful long-term monitoring tool for subtidal rocky reef fish communities. To test this, a repeated-measures field experiment comparing unbaited remote underwater video (RUV) with BRUV was conducted in the Tsitsikamma National Park Marine Protected Area between June 2008 and February 2010. The results demonstrate that BRUV was more efficient at surveying the entire fish community, specifically invertebrate carnivores, generalist carnivores and cartilaginous species. On the other hand, RUV was more effective at surveying microinvertebrate carnivores. High variability in the RUV data resulted in the method requiring a greater number of samples to achieve the same diagnostic power as BRUV. However, RUV required a shorter deployment and post-sampling video analysis time, making it more time efficient. Baited remote underwater video was more sensitive in the detection of differences in abundance between habitat types, while the RUV data were more prone to an intra-species methodological bias linked to the percentage of reef visible in the frame of view. The scale of the response to the presence of bait was inconsistent among species, indicating that behaviour determined the area surveyed within the bait plume of BRUV. The benefits gained by sampling the fish community with RUV do not outweigh those obtained by altering the community through the presence of bait. However, in combination, the 2 methods are highly effective at monitoring the subtidal fish communities in the Agulhas bioregion of South Africa. },

   abstract = {This paper reviews the socio-economic, ecological, and conservation experiences during the establishment of Marine Reserves (no-take Marine Protected Areas (MPA)) in New Zealand in an international context. Once operational, reserves became popular with the public and provided economic benefits. In one reserve, 'spill-over' of lobsters counter-balanced lost fishing. The reserves provided the control sites that showed the effects of fishing on ecosystems through depleted populations and habitat change due to trophic cascades. Studies in other countries indicated that these trophic cascades were common globally. Research showed reserves protect benthic and pelagic species, including those that move outside the reserves. These findings benefited from reserves having a map of seabed habitats and data on the relative abundance of species of ecological importance. Information on other species (e.g. macro-invertebrates), and previous and nearby fishing effort over time, may have provided additional insights.Marine Reserves can provide benefits to (1) conservation of species and habitats, (2) science as controls for fishing effects, and (3) fisheries as reference sites that conserve natural genetic and population structure, host brood-stock, and provide spill-over to nearby fisheries. They should be distributed geographically in networks that include replicated examples of habitats and species. To do so, they need to be suitably located, large enough, and enforced to fulfil these opportunities. However, these benefits remain limited by the relatively small area occupied by Marine Reserves within and between countries. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

   abstract = {Marine environments require monitoring to determine the effects of impacts such as climate change, coastal development and pollution and also to assess the effectiveness of conservation measures. Marine protected areas (MPAs) are being established globally and require periodic monitoring to determine whether their objectives are being met. Baited underwater video systems are becoming a popular method for monitoring change within protected fish populations, because they are less damaging to habitats than bottom trawling and allow for more statistical powerful comparisons to determine spatial and temporal patterns in the relative abundances, lengths and biomass of demersal and pelagic fishes. However, much remains uncertain about how interactions between the fish and bait and between the fish themselves affect the results obtained. Agonistic behaviours are frequently observed around the bait of the camera and potentially bias fish density estimates by altering the number and size classes seen at cameras. Here we counted the number of agonistic behaviours between pink snappers (Pagrus auratus), the size of fish involved and whether the fish left the field of view following such behaviours. The study consisted of 20 baited underwater video deployments inside a New Zealand marine reserve and 20 in adjacent open areas. We observed a significant relationship between the peak number of fish observed at the camera and the total number of agonistic behaviours, as well as the number of both aggressor and subordinate fish leaving the camera field of view following interactions. The slope of the latter relationship and thus the absolute numbers of fish leaving were higher for subordinate fish. As subordinates were significantly smaller than aggressors, the apparent size frequency distribution is likely skewed away from smaller size classes. The staying time of the fish and thus the maximum number of fish present at the camera will be reduced by agonistic behaviours and the absolute magnitude of this effect appears to be greater at high fish densities. Our results suggest that an overall effect of these phenomena is to underestimate the differences in abundance between MPAs and open areas, but also to overestimate differences in average size.},

A variety of visual census techniques are employed, however results are often incomparable due to differential methodological performance. Although comparability of data may promote improved assessment of fish populations, and thus management of often critically important nearshore fisheries, to date no standardized and agreed-upon survey method has emerged. This study describes the use of methods across the research community and identifies potential drivers of method selection. An online survey was distributed to researchers from academic, governmental, and non-governmental organizations internationally. Although many methods were identified, 89% of survey-based projects employed one of three methods?belt transect, stationary point count, and some variation of the timed swim method. The selection of survey method was independent of the research design (i.e., assessment goal) and region of study, but was related to the researcher?s home institution. While some researchers expressed willingness to modify their current survey protocols to more standardized protocols (76%), their willingness decreased when methodologies were tied to long-term datasets spanning five or more years. Willingness to modify current methodologies was also less common among academic researchers than resource managers. By understanding both the current application of methods and the reported motivations for method selection, we hope to focus discussions towards increasing the comparability of quantitative reef fish survey data.</p>},

Countless methods for estimating these parameters exist, making it essential to assess the limitations and biases associated with a particular sampling protocol. Here, we compare between 2 methods commonly used to survey nearshore fish assemblages. Although most commonly employed, underwater visual census (UVC) may yield biased estimates of abundance depending on the strength of a fish's behavioural response (i.e. avoidance, attraction) to the presence of divers. Baited remote underwater video (BRUV) techniques have shown promise in overcoming some of the limitations of UVC, but are unable to provide an absolute measure of density in turbulent environments. We compare the abilities of these 2 methods to survey the nearshore rocky reef ichthyofauna of Southeast Australia. We found that relative to BRUV, UVC recorded more individuals (in terms of all species, herbivores, cryptic species, and most territorial species), higher richness at both the species and family level, and higher biodiversity as measured using the Shannon Index. These findings remain even when the data were adjusted for differences in sampling effort. In contrast, BRUV recorded proportionally more mobile predators, and a more taxonomically distinct population, though only when taxonomic evenness was not taken into account. Twenty species were unique to UVC and 17 species unique to BRUV. Considering this, studies aimed at cataloguing diversity should apply multiple methods, However, when logistical or financial constraints limit biodiversity studies to only 1 method, UVC will likely provide a more complete estimate of temperate reef fish diversity than BRUV.},

   abstract = {Introduction: D-dimer assay, generally evaluated according to cutoff points calibrated for VTE exclusion, is used to estimate the individual risk of recurrence after a first idiopathic event of venous thromboembolism (VTE). Methods: Commercial D-dimer assays, evaluated according to predetermined cutoff levels for each assay, specific for age (lower in subjects <70 years) and gender (lower in males), were used in the recent DULCIS study. The present analysis compared the results obtained in the DULCIS with those that might have been had using the following different cutoff criteria: traditional cutoff for VTE exclusion, higher levels in subjects aged ≥60 years, or age multiplied by 10. Results: In young subjects, the DULCIS low cutoff levels resulted in half the recurrent events that would have occurred using the other criteria. In elderly patients, the DULCIS results were similar to those calculated for the two age-adjusted criteria. The adoption of traditional VTE exclusion criteria would have led to positive results in the large majority of elderly subjects, without a significant reduction in the rate of recurrent event. Conclusion: The results confirm the usefulness of the cutoff levels used in DULCIS.},

   abstract = {Human harvest of animals in the wild occurs in terrestrial and aquatic habitats throughout the world and is often intense. Harvest has the potential to cause three types of genetic change: alteration of population subdivision, loss of genetic variation, and selective genetic changes. To sustain the productivity of harvested populations, it is crucial to incorporate genetic considerations into management. Nevertheless, it is not necessary to disentangle genetic and environmental causes of phenotypic changes to develop management plans for individual species. We recommend recognizing that some genetic change due to harvest is inevitable. Management plans should be developed by applying basic genetic principles combined with molecular genetic monitoring to minimize harmful genetic change. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Multiplexing is the combination of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification products from multiple loci into a single lane of an electropho-retic gel (Olsen et al., 1996; Neff et al., 2000) and is accomplished either by co-amplification of multiple loci in a single reaction (Chamberlain et al., 1988) or by combination of products from multiple single-locus PCR amplifications (Olsen et al., 1996). The advantage of multiplexing micro-satellites lies in the significant reduction in both personnel time (labor) and consumable supplies generally required for large genotyping projects (Neff et al., 2000; Renshaw et al., 2006).},

   abstract = {The increase in the abun- dance of gray snapper (Lutjanus gri- seus) in Texas bays and estuaries over the past 30 years is correlated to increased wintertime surface water temperatures. Trends in the relative abundance of gray snapper are evalu- ated by using monthly fishery-inde- pendent monitoring data from each of the seven major estuaries along the Texas coast from 1978 through 2006. Environmental conditions during this period demonstrated increas- ing annual sea surface temperatures, although this increase was not season- ally uniform. The largest proportion of temperature increases was attributed to higher winter temperature mini- mums since 1993. Positive phases of the North Atlantic Oscillation, result- ing in wetter, warmer winters in the eastern United States have occurred nearly uninterrupted since the late 1970s, and unprecedented positive index values occurred between 1989 and 1995. Increases in water tempera- ture in Texas estuaries, beginning in the early 1990s, are postulated to provide both favorable over-winter- ing conditions for the newly settled juveniles and increased recruitment success. In the absence of cold win- ters, this species has established semipermanent estuarine popula- tions across the entire Texas coast. A shift to negative phases of the North Atlantic Oscillation will likely result in returns to colder winter tempera- ture minimums that could reverse any recent population gains.},

   abstract = {Climate change is expected to cause a poleward shift of many temperate species, however, a mechanistic understanding of how temperature and species' life histories interact to produce observed adult range is often lacking. We evaluated the hypothesis that juvenile thermal tolerance determines northern range in gray snapper (Lutjanus griseus), a species commonly caught as juveniles along the US Atlantic coast well north of their adult distribution, using a combined laboratory, field and modeling approach. The cumulative degree days below 17°C (CDD<17) survived by individuals maintained in the laboratory under ambient seasonal cooling conditions were used to quantify the chronic effects of prolonged but non-lethal low temperatures. Under ambient conditions, juveniles stopped feeding below 11.3°C, and the mean temperature at death was 10.2°C (+/-0.74S.D.). The CDD<17 endured by individuals ranged from 61.9 to 138.8 (83.54+/-22.44S.D.), and was positively related to fish size. The relation between CDD<17 and fish size was extrapolated to the maximum juvenile size in fall to provide an upper limit for survival in the wild (CDD<17=210days). Acute low temperature tolerance was evaluated in a second experiment that exposed juveniles to a constant rate of temperature decline (3°Cd-1), where feeding ceased at 10.3°C and death occurred at 7.0°C (+/-0.45S.D.). These thermal thresholds were combined with winter estuarine temperature data at 12 sites to evaluate potential overwinter survival along the US Atlantic coast. Of a total of 134 site-year combinations categorized based on the acute and chronic thresholds, the CDD<17 threshold (>210days) was more limiting than the acute threshold (minimum daily temperature<7.0°C) to survival of juveniles for a given site-year. To evaluate the relationship between juvenile thermal tolerance criteria and adult distributions, we quantified adult distribution using field observations in the western Atlantic Ocean compiled from a database of recreational divers. There was a strong correspondence between observations of adult gray snapper from the database of recreational divers vs. latitude with that of the predicted survival of juveniles vs. latitude from our analysis. The agreement between the laboratory-derived thermal tolerance metrics, the spatial distribution of winter temperature, and the distribution of adult gray snapper support the hypothesis that the adult range of gray snapper is largely limited by the overwinter survival of juveniles. Understanding the interaction between physiology and range is important for forecasting the impacts of climate change on other species of fish where juvenile tolerances are critical in determining range, particularly in seasonal systems. © 2012.},

Although conceptually accurate, judgments as to which habitat is more "essential" are limited by a lack of available information. This work provides much needed growth and production rates for gray snapper (Lutjanus griseus), an ontogenetic habitat shifting reef fish, during mangrove residency. Ages were estimated using modal progression analysis of length-frequency distributions coupled with a biologically-realistic spawning date. Growth estimates place age-1 L. griseus at 155 mm (TL), age-2 at 243, and age-3 at 302 mm. These size-at-age estimates are consistent with otolith-based studies and are a natural extension of linear growth models for early juveniles. Lutjanus griseus primarily use southeastern Florida mangrove shoreline habitats for approximately 2 years between 0.86 and 2.84 years of age. Corresponding production:biomass ratios for these cohorts were 1.51 and 0.90. While these values are similar to other estimates for fishes inhabiting vegetated coastal wetlands in North America, they are much less than new estimates from a Bahamian mangrove creek system. These new data highlight important differences between the habitat value of mangrove shorelines of continental (low-relief) and island (high-relief) systems.},

Gray snapper across all size classes tested (13.5–24.5cm total length) acclimated successfully to hypo- and hyper-saline environments (0–60 ppt) after an adjustment period of ?96 h. However, abrupt transfers to 70 ppt resulted in 100% mortality within 48 h. Laboratory results were then compared with field measurements obtained after fish were captured in low salinity (0–4 ppt) or marine (?30 ppt) habitats, suggesting that osmoregulatory processes occurred similarly in both settings. Overall, findings suggest that gray snapper possess similar or higher osmoregulatory capabilities compared to many euryhaline species examined to date, and thus should be considered a euryhaline species.},

Data showed overlap for <sup>13</sup>C and <sup>18</sup>O isotope measurements for the juvenile portion of sub-adult otoliths to isotope values for the middle and lower Florida Keys regions, thereby suggesting a migratory connection. Specific nursery habitats contributed approximately 93 % of individuals sampled for yellowtail and approximately 98 % for gray snapper to the Florida Keys coral reef tract. Results from this study indicate locally important source regions and habitats for the successful recruitment of fish to the Florida Keys coral reef tract.},

Exact tests of homogeneity over all microsatellites were significant for both allele (P = 0.004) and genotype (P = 0.020) distributions; homogeneity tests for mtDNA haplotype distributions were not significant (P = 0.940). Weak but significant divergence (phi(CT) = 0.007, P = 0.020) among localities (microsatellites) was indicated by spatial analysis of molecular variance (SAMOVA), where three distinct groups (one from the northwestern Gulf, one from the northcentral/northeastern Gulf, and one from the east coast of Florida) were inferred. Spatial autocorrelation analysis (microsatellites) revealed an isolation-by-distance effect among samples from the northern Gulf. Levels of genetic variation in both microsatellites and mtDNA were low as compared to other lutjanids in U.S. waters, and Bayesian analysis of genetic demography revealed a two to three order-of-magnitude decrease in effective population size of Gray Snapper over the past 5,300 or so years (0.05 quartile of 81 years). The evidence of genetically distinct stocks and the decline in effective population size have implications for management of Gray Snapper resources in U.S. waters.},

   abstract = {Newly recruited juvenile gray snapper Lutjanus griseus were collected each fall for two consecutive years (2000 and 2001) from sites in Florida and North Carolina. Spawning, settlement, and growth patterns were compared across sites based on otolith microstructure. Larval otolith growth trajectories were generally similar for larvae from different sites and years; however, the mean pelagic larval duration (PLD) was 1 d longer for fish from North Carolina than for fish from the more southern sites. As a result, fish were larger at settlement to North Carolina. Estimated juvenile growth rates ranged between 0.62 and 0.88 mm/d and differed across sites and years, growth being generally faster at the southern sites. Water temperature accounts for some of this variability; however, site-specific differences in other factors probably contributed to some of the observed differences in growth. Back-calculated spawning patterns showed a lunar association with the new and first-quarter moons at all sites except for North Carolina. Settlement patterns were lunar cyclic as well: settlement pulsed during the third-quarter and new moons at all sites, and in North Carolina an additional pulse associated with the full moon was present. Patterns of larval and juvenile growth coupled with recruitment dynamics across the latitudinal gradient are consistent with northward Gulf Stream transport of larvae from southern spawning sites.},

   abstract = {Many recreational fisheries are subject to varying degrees of catch-and-release fishing through regulations and conservation-minded anglers. Clearly, releasing a proportion of the catch improves conservation of the fishery, yet it is not clear how the released catch contributes to angling quality. If fish change their behavior to lower their individual catchability after they have been caught, then angler catch rates may not be proportional to fish density. Therefore, even catch-and-release fisheries could exhibit poor angling quality if there is sufficiently high angler effort. We tested this idea by experimentally fishing five small lakes that contained rainbow trout Oncorhynchus mykiss in the interior of British Columbia. We found that with sustained effort of 8 angler-hours�d-1�ha-1 and complete release of the catch, catch rates quickly dropped within 7-10 d. Given the individual capture histories of tagged fish, the most parsimonious catchability model incorporated learning and heterogeneity into intrinsic catchability. The best-fit parameter values suggest that the population contained a group of highly catchable fish that were quickly caught and then learned to avoid hooks. There was a seasonal decrease in catchability that was independent of angling; however, it was not sufficient to explain the data. Our results indicate that catch rates may decline because of high angling effort even when the number of fish remains constant. Therefore, management goals that go beyond conservation issues and attempt to maximize angler satisfaction must account for effort density on a recreational fishery.},

Until Day 10 alter hatching, while the larvae were still feeding on their yolk, the external food situation did not affect the increment width of the lapilli or the RNA/DNA ratios.

They can be divided by target levels in three groups: 1) at the organism level as ecophysiologic indicators, indicators such as RNA:DNA ratios, DNA:dry weight and RNA:protein, 2) at the population level, indicators such as growth rate, starvation incidence or fisheries impact indicators, and 3) at the community level, indicators such as trophic interactions, exergy indices and prey identification. The nucleic acids derived indices, especially RNA:DNA ratio, have been applied with success as indicators of nutritional condition, well been and growth in marine organisms. They are also useful as indicators of natural or anthropogenic impacts in marine population and communities, such as upwelling or dredge fisheries, respectively. They can help in understanding important issues of marine ecology such as trophic interactions in marine environment, fish and invertebrate recruitment failure and biodiversity changes, without laborious work of counting, measuring and identification of small marine organisms. Besides the objective of integrate nucleic acid derived indices across levels of organization, the paper will also include a general characterization of most used nucleic acid derived indices in marine ecology and also advantages and limitations of them. We can conclude that using indicators, such RNA:DNA ratios and other nucleic acids derived indices concomitantly with organism and ecosystems measures of responses to climate change (distribution, abundance, activity, metabolic rate, survival) will allow for the development of more rigorous and realistic predictions of the effects of anthropogenic climate change on marine systems.},

Variation of condition indices was more frequent at the week scale (sampling periods with fortnight intervals) than at the daily scale (consecutive days in each sampling period) in all species. Water temperature was correlated with biochemical indices, while salinity showed no effect, evidencing the influence of environmental short-term variation (temperature) on biochemical condition in natural populations. Yet, decreasing individual variability in fish condition was observed along the sampled weeks, resulting in a more homogeneous condition of populations, particularly for T. trachurus likely due to a more stable coastal environment. Biochemical indices proved to be sensitive to short-term environmental variability, despite species-specific responses.},

RNA: DNA ratios were correlated positively with both absolute (mm day-') and instantaneous (% day-') growth rates. The effect of starvation was evaluated daily over 5 day periods at three ontogenetic stages (20, 30, and 40 days). Significant differences in RNA:DNA ratios of fed and starved larvae were observed and changes in biochemical condition were detected statistically within 1 to 2 days of food deprivation. RNA:DNA ratios decreased continuously over the entire 5 day starvation period, with relative reductions in RNA : DNA ratios decreasing with increasing age. Die1 variations in RNA : DNA ratios were investigated in controlled (constant) and natural (cyclical) temperature environments over a 48 h period. RNA: DNA ratios were highest during daytime periods (0800, 1200, 1600, 2000 hours) and markedly reduced at night (0000, 0400 hours). Since RNA: DNA ratios from controlled and natural temperature treatments did not differ significantly, cyclical variations in temperature did not appear responsible for die1 variations in biochemical condition. Findings from this study support the use of nucleic acids as reliable indices of growth and condition and suggest that RNA: DNA ratios are potentially suitable measures to assess the condition of wild-caught S. ocellatus},

The ratio of RNA-DNA (R/D) has been shown to respond to changes in feeding conditions and growth after periods as short as 1-3 days in a variety of fish species. The earliest studies used primarily UV-based methods, but most investigators now use more sensitive, fluorometric dye-binding assays to estimate RNA and DNA in individual larvae. These newer methods are very sensitive to procedural details and choice of standards. Analytical methods, normalization and calibration procedures to optimize information obtained from nucleic acid analysis are discussed. We present examples illustrating the technique's utility, and problems encountered when applying nucleic acid-based indices to fish larvae and early juveniles. The wide use of R/D analysis in studies of fish early life stages, together with a proliferation of analytical methods, demands a major intercalibration exercise.},

   abstract = {ABSTRACT: Non-intrusive and non-destructive acquisition of length measurements for marine megafauna is increasingly valuable given growing threats to many species long-term survival. Stereo videography provides a means of obtaining length data with minimal impact on the organism and minimal observer bias. However, for many researchers, there are still significant financial barriers to employing stereo videography. Small-action cameras have reduced costs, but camera calibration still requires significant investment in software and equipment. Here, we trial open source calibration procedures using the R package StereoMorph and a simple 2D checkerboard as a calibration object to test if this approach yields accurate length data. We used a stereo-video system comprising 2 GoPro cameras to estimate the lengths of known targets in a pool and the lengths of oceanic whitetip sharks \textit\{Carcharhinus longimanus in situ\}. Sharks were restrained in water alongside a boat and measured with a tape measure for comparison with the stereo-video lengths. Both pool and field trials yielded accurate results comparable to previous studies using 3D calibration cubes. Stereo-video measurements of lengths \{>\}1 m had proportional errors of \{<\}1% in the pool and \{<\}3.0% (64.2 mm) in comparison with tape-measured lengths of sharks in the field. Our open source calibration methods and affordable GoPro-based stereo-video system yielded measurements that are comparable to other systems that use 3D calibration techniques and more expensive cameras. Additionally, we improve on previous attempts of 2D calibration approaches.},

We hypothesize that these morphological patterns are primarily driven by differences in shark predation. Morphological differences are not consistent with plausible alternative explanations (habitat complexity, temperature, light, current, food availability, prey targets, competition) as primary drivers. These results provide field evidence of morphological changes in prey potentially due to predator depletions consistent with ecological predictions; specifically, predator loss caused a reduction in the size of prey morphological traits associated with predator detection and evasion. While our analysis cannot differentiate between rapid evolutionary change versus morphological plasticity due to shark depletions, either possible outcome would indicate that predator removals may have profound effects on body shapes of prey communities.

Very little is known about the effects of life history and ecological traits (e.g., mobility, growth, and habitat) on responses of fish species to marine reserves. Using 40 data sets from 12 European marine reserves, we show that there is significant variation in the response of different species of fish to protection and that this heterogeneity can be explained, in part, by differences in their traits. Densities of targeted size-classes of commercial species were greater in protected than unprotected areas.

However, contrary to previous theoretical findings, even mobile species with wide home ranges benefited from protection: the effect of protection was at least as strong for mobile species as it was for sedentary ones. Noncommercial bycatch and unexploited species rarely responded to protection, and when they did (in the case of unexploited bentho-pelagic species), they exhibited the opposite response: their densities were lower inside reserves.

   abstract = {We examined movement patterns of sportfish that were tagged in the northern Indian River Lagoon, Florida, between 1990 and 1999 to assess the degree of fish exchange between an estuarine no-take zone (NTZ) and surrounding waters. The tagged fish were from seven species: red drum (Sciaenops ocellatus); black drum (Pogonias cromis); sheepshead (Archosargus probatocephalus); common snook (Centropomus undecimalis); spotted seatrout (Cynoscion nebulosus); bull shark (Carcharhinus leucas); and crevalle jack (Caranx hippos). A total of 403 tagged fish were recaptured during the study period, including 65 individuals that emigrated from the NTZ and 16 individuals that immigrated into the NTZ from surrounding waters of the lagoon. Migration distances between the original tagging location and the sites where emigrating fish were recaptured were from 0 to 150 km, and these migration distances appeared to be influenced by the proximity of the NTZ to spawning areas or other habitats that are important to specific life-history stages of individual species. Fish that immigrated into the NTZ moved distances ranging from approximately 10 to 75 km. Recapture rates for sportfish species that migrated across the NTZ boundary suggested that more individuals may move into the protected habitats than move out. These data demonstrated that although this estuarine no-take reserve can protect species from fishing, it may also serve to extract exploitable individuals from surrounding fisheries; therefore, if the no-take reserve does function to replenish surrounding fisheries, then increased egg production and larval export may be more important mechanisms of replenishment than the spillover of excess adults from the reserve into fishable areas.},

   abstract = {Many calcified structures produce periodic growth increments useful for age determination at the annual or daily scale. However, age determination is invariably accompanied by various sources of error, some of which can have a serious effect on age-structured calculations. This review highlights the best available methods for insuring ageing accuracy and quantifying ageing precision, whether in support of large-scale production ageing or a small-scale research project. Included in this review is a critical overview of methods used to initiate and pursue an accurate and controlled ageing program, including (but not limited to) validation of an ageing method. The distinction between validation of absolute age and increment periodicity is emphasized, as is the importance of determining the age of first increment formation. Based on an analysis of 372 papers reporting age validation since 1983, considerable progress has been made in age validation efforts in recent years. Nevertheless, several of the age validation methods which have been used routinely are of dubious value, particularly marginal increment analysis. The two major measures of precision, average percent error and coefficient of variation, are shown to be functionally equivalent, and a conversion factor relating the two is presented. Through use of quality control monitoring, ageing errors are readily detected and quantified; reference collections are the key to both quality control and reduction of costs. Although some level of random ageing error is unavoidable, such error can often be corrected after the fact using statistical (' digital sharpening ') methods.},

   abstract = {Argyrozona argyrozona is an important component of the South African commercial linefishery. The purpose of this study was to develop a reliable protocol for estimating age and calculating growth. Methods based on both otoliths and mark-recapture data were investigated. Transverse sagittal sections from the Tsitsikamma National Park (TNP) showed clear opaque and translucent growth increments. Marginal growth zone analysis and mark-recapture of chemically tagged fish (Oxytetracycline) revealed that these were deposited on an annual basis: opaque in summer and translucent in winter. The first translucent check was shown by daily increment counts to mark the completion of the first annulus (i.e. not a juvenile/false check). Within reader (between counts) and between readers average percentage error (APE) was 5.3 and 1.8, respectively, showing that readability of carpenter otoliths is high. Comparison between whole and sectioned otoliths showed that the former significantly underestimated the age of fish older than 10 years (P<0.01). The maximum age obtained from whole otoliths was 16 years while that obtained from otolith sections was 27 years. Based on realistic L∞estimate and the distribution of residuals, the three parameter von Bertalanffy growth function adequately fitted the observed length-at-age data derived from otolith sections. Growth rates did not differ significantly between sexes (f=2.217, P=0.09). Growth of carpenter in the TNP is described by the following equation:Lt=623(1-e-0.08(t-1.96))A large proportion (68%) of the individual growth rates derived from mark-recapture data were below those predicted by the otolith based von Bertalanffy growth model (P<0.01). This was attributed to the negative influence of external tags as hydroids, frequently occurring on the tags of recaptured fish, were observed to cause severe lesions and in some cases, extensive fin damage. This brings into question the use of mark-recapture studies to calculate growth of some species. © 2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

   abstract = {We examined movement patterns of sportfish that were tagged in the northern Indian River Lagoon, Florida, between 1990 and 1999 to assess the degree of fish exchange between an estuarine no-take zone (NTZ) and surrounding waters. The tagged fish were from seven species: red drum (Sciaenops ocellatus); black drum (Pogonias cromis); sheepshead (Archosargus probatocephalus); common snook (Centropomus undecimalis); spotted seatrout (Cynoscion nebulosus); bull shark (Carcharhinus leucas); and crevalle jack (Caranx hippos). A total of 403 tagged fish were recaptured during the study period, including 65 individuals that emigrated from the NTZ and 16 individuals that immigrated into the NTZ from surrounding waters of the lagoon. Migration distances between the original tagging location and the sites where emigrating fish were recaptured were from 0 to 150 km, and these migration distances appeared to be influenced by the proximity of the NTZ to spawning areas or other habitats that are important to specific life-history stages of individual species. Fish that immigrated into the NTZ moved distances ranging from approximately 10 to 75 km. Recapture rates for sportfish species that migrated across the NTZ boundary suggested that more individuals may move into the protected habitats than move out. These data demonstrated that although this estuarine no-take reserve can protect species from fishing, it may also serve to extract exploitable individuals from surrounding fisheries; therefore, if the no-take reserve does function to replenish surrounding fisheries, then increased egg production and larval export may be more important mechanisms of replenishment than the spillover of excess adults from the reserve into fishable areas.},

Multivariate analysis revealed four distinct groups. Each group was represented by a specific species composition and characterised by different environmental conditions, in particular, the sediment characteristics and salinity. Abundance/biomass comparison (ABC) indicated that the lower part of the estuary is under environmental stress and is dominated by opportunistic species. The subtidal macrobenthic community of the lower Lima estuary differed between sites but not between seasons of the year.},

There are robust demonstrations of conservation benefits, but fishery benefits remain controversial.

Within 5 years of creation, a network of five small reserves in St. Lucia increased adjacent catches of artisanal fishers by between 46 and 90%, depending on the type of gear the fishers used. In Florida, reserve zones in the Merritt Island National Wildlife Refuge have supplied increasing numbers of world record–sized fish to adjacent recreational fisheries since the 1970s.

   abstract = {Fisheries on coral reefs are highly complex, can be very productive, but typically have little or no management. Widespread overfishing and declining yields reveal an acute need for proper management. However, conventional management methods are inappropriate for two main reasons: they require much information on the biology of stocks and are expensive and difficult to enforce. Use of marine reserves has been suggested as an alternative. Protective management potentially has several important benefits including (i) protection of spawning stocks; (ii) provision of recruits to replenish fishing grounds; (iii) enhancement of catches in adjacent unprotected areas through emigration; (iv) minimal requirement for information on biology of stocks; and (v) ease of enforcement. However, the effectiveness of the reserve approach has not been properly tested. We evaluate the evidence available to test whether reserves function as predicted on theoretical grounds. In general, field studies from widespread sites around the globe support predictions of increases in abundance and average size of fishes in protected areas. However, evidence for enhanced catches in adjacent areas is more limited, and evidence to show that reserves can restock fishing grounds is lacking. Nevertheless, protective management appears to hold much promise for low-cost management of reef fisheries. Research programs in several areas of the Caribbean and Indo-Pacific have now been launched to refine the approach. CR - Copyright &#169; 1993 Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences},

   abstract = {Sea turtles are highly migratory and usually dispersed, but aggregate off beaches during the nesting season, rendering them vulnerable to coastal threats. Consequently, coastal Marine Protection Areas (MPAs) have been used to facilitate the recovery of turtle populations, but the effectiveness of these programs is uncertain as most have been operating for less than a single turtle generation (or<20 yr). South Africa, however, hosts one of the longest running conservation programs, protecting nesting loggerhead (Caretta caretta) and leatherback (Dermochelys coriacea) turtles since 1963 in a series of coastal MPAs. This provides a unique opportunity to evaluate the long-term effect of spatial protection on the abundance of two highly migratory turtle species with different life history characteristics. Population responses were assessed by modeling the number of nests over time in an index area (13 km) and an expanded monitoring area (53 km) with varying survey effort. Loggerhead abundance increased dramatically from∼250 to>1700 nests pa (index area) especially over the last decade, while leatherback abundance increased initially∼10 to 70 nests pa (index area), but then stabilized. Although leatherbacks have higher reproductive output per female and comparable remigration periods and hatching success to loggerheads, the leatherback population failed to expand. Our results suggest that coastal MPAs can work but do not guarantee the recovery of sea turtle populations as pressures change over time. Causes considered for the lack of population growth include factors in the MPA (expansion into unmonitored areas or incubation environment) of outside of the MPA (including carrying capacity and fishing mortality). Conservation areas for migratory species thus require careful design to account for species-specific needs, and need to be monitored to keep track of changing pressures.},

   abstract = {The application of no-take areas in fisheries remains controversial. Critics argue that many targeted species are too mobile to benefit from area protection and that no-take areas are only appropriate for resident species. The degree of protection does not depend on the size of the no-take area but rather on the time fish reside inside its boundaries during key life-history events (i.e., spawning) and during periods of peak fishing activity. We evaluated the potential of a small no-take marine protected area (MPA) inside a coastal embayment as a harvest refuge for a mobile, possibly migratory, long-lived fish species. We used acoustic telemetry to track movements of 30 transmitter-tagged white stumpnose (Rhabdosargus globiceps) across and on both sides of the boundary of a small (34 km(2)) no-take area over a full year. Being landlocked on 3 sides, the location of the MPA inside the lagoon made it practical to detect all boundary crossings and to calculate the time individual fish used the MPA. We detected frequent movements across the boundary, with strong seasonal and individual variations. There were significant differences in MPA use patterns between fish from different release areas. The time spent in the MPA by individual fish during summer (mean 50%; max 98%) was out of proportion with the size of that area (4% of total habitat). Summer coincided with peak recreational fishing activity and with the spawning season of this species. The small MPA provided a refuge for a part of the spawning stock of white stumpnose. Our findings suggest that if strategically placed, a small no-take area can be effective in protecting mobile species and that models of spillover from no-take areas should account for seasonal and individual variation in area use and the spatiotemporal distribution of fish and fishers.},

   abstract = {The great majority of marine protected areas (MPAs) fail to meet their management objectives. So MPAs can be effective conservation tools, we recommend two paradigm shifts, the first related to how they are located and the second related to how they are managed. MPAs are unlikely to be effective if they are located in areas that are subject to numerous, and often uncontrollable, external stressors from atmospheric, terrestrial, and oceanic sources, all of which can degrade the environment and compromise protection. MPA effectiveness is also limited by low institutional and community capacity for management and inappropriate size with respect to ecological needs. In particular, the check list approach to management does not ensure that key threats are dealt with, or that management expenditures provide a quantifiable return. We recommend a business planning approach to MPA management, in which managers focus on the viability of the management system, i.e., the ability of the MPA to provide ecological goods and services to its target users over the long term. © 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

   abstract = {The success of MPAs in conserving fishing resources and protecting marine biodiversity relies strongly on how well they meet their planned (or implicit) management goals. From a review of empirical studies aiming at assessing the ecological effects of Mediterranean and Macaronesian MPAs, we conclude that establishing an MPA is successful for (i) increasing the abundance/biomass, (ii) increasing the proportion of larger/older individuals, and (iii) enhancing the fecundity of commercially harvested populations; also, MPAs demonstrated to be effective for (iv) augmenting local fishery yields through biomass exportation from the protected area, and (v) inducing shifts in fish assemblage structure by increasing the dominance of large predator species. However, the attraction for tourism and diving due to ecological benefits of protection can cause damages likely to reverse some of the MPA effects. Other expected effects are more subject to uncertainty, and hence need more research, such as (vi) causing density-dependent changes in life history traits and (vii) protecting the recruitment of commercially important species, (viii) protecting marine biodiversity (including genetic diversity), (ix) causing ecosystem-wide effects such as trophic cascades, and (x) increasing community and ecosystem stability, thus promoting resilience and faster recovery from disturbance. Meta-analysis of data arising from these case studies are used to establish the overall effect of MPAs, and its relationship to MPA features, such as size of no-take area or time since protection. Based on the review and the meta-analyses, specific recommendations are provided for MPA management, regarding the establishment of goals and objectives, site selection, MPA design and zoning, planning, and monitoring. Finally, a series of recommendations for MPA research are offered to drive future research in MPA issues in the Mediterranean and Macaronesia. © 2008 Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved.},

The effects of marine reserves are heterogeneous. Despite theoretical findings, empirical studies have previously found no effect of size on the effectiveness of marine reserves in protecting commercial fish stocks. Using 58 datasets from 19 European marine reserves, we show that reserve size and age do matter: Increasing the size of the no-take zone increases the density of commercial fishes within the reserve compared with outside; whereas the size of the buffer zone has the opposite effect. Moreover, positive effects of marine reserve on commercial fish species and species richness are linked to the time elapsed since the establishment of the protection scheme. The reserve size-dependency of the response to protection has strong implications for the spatial management of coastal areas because marine reserves are used for spatial zoning.},

   abstract = {Seascape variability may confound assessments on the effectiveness of no-take marine reserves (NTMRs) in conserving biodiversity. In most cases baseline data are lacking, resulting in evaluations of NTMR effectiveness being Control Impact (CI) assessments. Even with independent replicate areas among management zones, this approach can make it difficult to detect zone effects if seascape attributes, such as habitat structural complexity varies among experimental areas. To determine the importance of structural complexity in evaluations of NTMR effectiveness we performed assessments on the abundance of a targeted fish, yellowtail kingfish (Seriola lalandi), in the Lord Howe Island Marine Park (LHIMP). We compared assessments which did and did not account for structural complexity, quantified using high resolution multibeam bathymetry. Despite almost 3 times more S. lalandi in NTMRs, the traditional CI assessment explained only 3% of the variation in the abundance of S. lalandi and revealed no clear effect of protection. Incorporating structural complexity into the assessment increased the deviance explained to 65% and uncovered an important interaction between zone and structural complexity. Greater abundances of S. lalandi were detected in NTMRs compared to fished zones but only on highly complex reefs. By accounting for structural complexity, we demonstrate that the precision and accuracy of NTMR assessments can be improved, leading to a better understanding of ecological change in response to this conservation strategy. Consequently, where marine park zones vary greatly in structural complexity, we strongly advocate for quantifying and accounting for such variability in assessments of NTMR performance.},

   abstract = {Marine reserves have been widely promoted as conservation and fishery management tools. There are robust demonstrations of conservation benefits, but fishery benefits remain controversial. We show that marine reserves in Florida (United States) and St. Lucia have enhanced adjacent fisheries. Within 5 years of creation, a network of five small reserves in St. Lucia increased adjacent catches of artisanal fishers by between 46 and 90%, depending on the type of gear the fishers used. In Florida, reserve zones in the Merritt Island National Wildlife Refuge have supplied increasing numbers of world record–sized fish to adjacent recreational fisheries since the 1970s. Our study confirms theoretical predictions that marine reserves can play a key role in supporting fisheries.},

Univariate and multivariate analyses were used to establish patterns in species distribution, abundance, and biomass; and to determine the influence of site and season on the subtidal macrobenthic community. A total of 10 1 macrobenthic taxa were identified and values of diversity were generally low indicating a high degree of dominance of few species. Average abundance and biomass per site ranged from 46.7 to 8060 ind. m(-2) and 0.56 to 28.96 g AFDW m(-2), respectively. Abra alba was most abundant and had the highest biomass. Multivariate analysis revealed four distinct groups. Each group was represented by a specific species composition and characterised by different environmental conditions, in particular, the sediment characteristics and salinity. Abundance/biomass comparison (ABC) indicated that the lower part of the estuary is under environmental stress and is dominated by opportunistic species. The subtidal macrobenthic community of the lower Lima estuary differed between sites but not between seasons of the year.},

   abstract = {We examined movement patterns of sportfish that were tagged in the northern Indian River Lagoon, Florida, between 1990 and 1999 to assess the degree of fish exchange between an estuarine no-take zone (NTZ) and surrounding waters. The tagged fish were from seven species: red drum (Sciaenops ocellatus); black drum (Pogonias cromis); sheepshead (Archosargus probatocephalus); common snook (Centropomus undecimalis); spotted seatrout (Cynoscion nebulosus); bull shark (Carcharhinus leucas); and crevalle jack (Caranx hippos). A total of 403 tagged fish were recaptured during the study period, including 65 individuals that emigrated from the NTZ and 16 individuals that immigrated into the NTZ from surrounding waters of the lagoon. Migration distances between the original tagging location and the sites where emigrating fish were recaptured were from 0 to 150 km, and these migration distances appeared to be influenced by the proximity of the NTZ to spawning areas or other habitats that are important to specific life-history stages of individual species. Fish that immigrated into the NTZ moved distances ranging from approximately 10 to 75 km. Recapture rates for sportfish species that migrated across the NTZ boundary suggested that more individuals may move into the protected habitats than move out. These data demonstrated that although this estuarine no-take reserve can protect species from fishing, it may also serve to extract exploitable individuals from surrounding fisheries; therefore, if the no-take reserve does function to replenish surrounding fisheries, then increased egg production and larval export may be more important mechanisms of replenishment than the spillover of excess adults from the reserve into fishable areas.},

   abstract = {Seascape variability may confound assessments on the effectiveness of no-take marine reserves (NTMRs) in conserving biodiversity. In most cases baseline data are lacking, resulting in evaluations of NTMR effectiveness being Control Impact (CI) assessments. Even with independent replicate areas among management zones, this approach can make it difficult to detect zone effects if seascape attributes, such as habitat structural complexity varies among experimental areas. To determine the importance of structural complexity in evaluations of NTMR effectiveness we performed assessments on the abundance of a targeted fish, yellowtail kingfish (Seriola lalandi), in the Lord Howe Island Marine Park (LHIMP). We compared assessments which did and did not account for structural complexity, quantified using high resolution multibeam bathymetry. Despite almost 3 times more S. lalandi in NTMRs, the traditional CI assessment explained only 3% of the variation in the abundance of S. lalandi and revealed no clear effect of protection. Incorporating structural complexity into the assessment increased the deviance explained to 65% and uncovered an important interaction between zone and structural complexity. Greater abundances of S. lalandi were detected in NTMRs compared to fished zones but only on highly complex reefs. By accounting for structural complexity, we demonstrate that the precision and accuracy of NTMR assessments can be improved, leading to a better understanding of ecological change in response to this conservation strategy. Consequently, where marine park zones vary greatly in structural complexity, we strongly advocate for quantifying and accounting for such variability in assessments of NTMR performance.},

BUVs were effective in attracting fishes to within camera range with fish numbers plateauing within 20 minutes of deployment. The fish assemblages were dominated by snapper (Pagrus auratus). A boat equipped with a 60 HP 4 stroke engine made two passes past the BUV and then circled the area three times. Video was analyzed for fish number, interactions with the bait jar, and intraspecific interactions. Preliminary results suggest that fishes inhabiting the protected area showed less response to motorboat transits compared to fishes outside the area. The experiments suggest that anthropogenic noise in the marine environment can effect fish behavior and that BUVs provide the capability to monitor these interactions.},

   abstract = {Fisheries on coral reefs are highly complex, can be very productive, but typically have little or no management. Widespread overfishing and declining yields reveal an acute need for proper management. However, conventional management methods are inappropriate for two main reasons: they require much information on the biology of stocks and are expensive and difficult to enforce. Use of marine reserves has been suggested as an alternative. Protective management potentially has several important benefits including (i) protection of spawning stocks; (ii) provision of recruits to replenish fishing grounds; (iii) enhancement of catches in adjacent unprotected areas through emigration; (iv) minimal requirement for information on biology of stocks; and (v) ease of enforcement. However, the effectiveness of the reserve approach has not been properly tested. We evaluate the evidence available to test whether reserves function as predicted on theoretical grounds. In general, field studies from widespread sites around the globe support predictions of increases in abundance and average size of fishes in protected areas. However, evidence for enhanced catches in adjacent areas is more limited, and evidence to show that reserves can restock fishing grounds is lacking. Nevertheless, protective management appears to hold much promise for low-cost management of reef fisheries. Research programs in several areas of the Caribbean and Indo-Pacific have now been launched to refine the approach. CR - Copyright &#169; 1993 Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences},

   abstract = {Sea turtles are highly migratory and usually dispersed, but aggregate off beaches during the nesting season, rendering them vulnerable to coastal threats. Consequently, coastal Marine Protection Areas (MPAs) have been used to facilitate the recovery of turtle populations, but the effectiveness of these programs is uncertain as most have been operating for less than a single turtle generation (or<20 yr). South Africa, however, hosts one of the longest running conservation programs, protecting nesting loggerhead (Caretta caretta) and leatherback (Dermochelys coriacea) turtles since 1963 in a series of coastal MPAs. This provides a unique opportunity to evaluate the long-term effect of spatial protection on the abundance of two highly migratory turtle species with different life history characteristics. Population responses were assessed by modeling the number of nests over time in an index area (13 km) and an expanded monitoring area (53 km) with varying survey effort. Loggerhead abundance increased dramatically from∼250 to>1700 nests pa (index area) especially over the last decade, while leatherback abundance increased initially∼10 to 70 nests pa (index area), but then stabilized. Although leatherbacks have higher reproductive output per female and comparable remigration periods and hatching success to loggerheads, the leatherback population failed to expand. Our results suggest that coastal MPAs can work but do not guarantee the recovery of sea turtle populations as pressures change over time. Causes considered for the lack of population growth include factors in the MPA (expansion into unmonitored areas or incubation environment) of outside of the MPA (including carrying capacity and fishing mortality). Conservation areas for migratory species thus require careful design to account for species-specific needs, and need to be monitored to keep track of changing pressures.},

   abstract = {The application of no-take areas in fisheries remains controversial. Critics argue that many targeted species are too mobile to benefit from area protection and that no-take areas are only appropriate for resident species. The degree of protection does not depend on the size of the no-take area but rather on the time fish reside inside its boundaries during key life-history events (i.e., spawning) and during periods of peak fishing activity. We evaluated the potential of a small no-take marine protected area (MPA) inside a coastal embayment as a harvest refuge for a mobile, possibly migratory, long-lived fish species. We used acoustic telemetry to track movements of 30 transmitter-tagged white stumpnose (Rhabdosargus globiceps) across and on both sides of the boundary of a small (34 km(2)) no-take area over a full year. Being landlocked on 3 sides, the location of the MPA inside the lagoon made it practical to detect all boundary crossings and to calculate the time individual fish used the MPA. We detected frequent movements across the boundary, with strong seasonal and individual variations. There were significant differences in MPA use patterns between fish from different release areas. The time spent in the MPA by individual fish during summer (mean 50%; max 98%) was out of proportion with the size of that area (4% of total habitat). Summer coincided with peak recreational fishing activity and with the spawning season of this species. The small MPA provided a refuge for a part of the spawning stock of white stumpnose. Our findings suggest that if strategically placed, a small no-take area can be effective in protecting mobile species and that models of spillover from no-take areas should account for seasonal and individual variation in area use and the spatiotemporal distribution of fish and fishers.},

   abstract = {The great majority of marine protected areas (MPAs) fail to meet their management objectives. So MPAs can be effective conservation tools, we recommend two paradigm shifts, the first related to how they are located and the second related to how they are managed. MPAs are unlikely to be effective if they are located in areas that are subject to numerous, and often uncontrollable, external stressors from atmospheric, terrestrial, and oceanic sources, all of which can degrade the environment and compromise protection. MPA effectiveness is also limited by low institutional and community capacity for management and inappropriate size with respect to ecological needs. In particular, the check list approach to management does not ensure that key threats are dealt with, or that management expenditures provide a quantifiable return. We recommend a business planning approach to MPA management, in which managers focus on the viability of the management system, i.e., the ability of the MPA to provide ecological goods and services to its target users over the long term. © 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

   abstract = {The success of MPAs in conserving fishing resources and protecting marine biodiversity relies strongly on how well they meet their planned (or implicit) management goals. From a review of empirical studies aiming at assessing the ecological effects of Mediterranean and Macaronesian MPAs, we conclude that establishing an MPA is successful for (i) increasing the abundance/biomass, (ii) increasing the proportion of larger/older individuals, and (iii) enhancing the fecundity of commercially harvested populations; also, MPAs demonstrated to be effective for (iv) augmenting local fishery yields through biomass exportation from the protected area, and (v) inducing shifts in fish assemblage structure by increasing the dominance of large predator species. However, the attraction for tourism and diving due to ecological benefits of protection can cause damages likely to reverse some of the MPA effects. Other expected effects are more subject to uncertainty, and hence need more research, such as (vi) causing density-dependent changes in life history traits and (vii) protecting the recruitment of commercially important species, (viii) protecting marine biodiversity (including genetic diversity), (ix) causing ecosystem-wide effects such as trophic cascades, and (x) increasing community and ecosystem stability, thus promoting resilience and faster recovery from disturbance. Meta-analysis of data arising from these case studies are used to establish the overall effect of MPAs, and its relationship to MPA features, such as size of no-take area or time since protection. Based on the review and the meta-analyses, specific recommendations are provided for MPA management, regarding the establishment of goals and objectives, site selection, MPA design and zoning, planning, and monitoring. Finally, a series of recommendations for MPA research are offered to drive future research in MPA issues in the Mediterranean and Macaronesia. © 2008 Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved.},

Using 58 datasets from 19 European marine reserves, we show that reserve size and age do matter: Increasing the size of the no-take zone increases the density of commercial fishes within the reserve compared with outside; whereas the size of the buffer zone has the opposite effect. Moreover, positive effects of marine reserve on commercial fish species and species richness are linked to the time elapsed since the establishment of the protection scheme.

A drastic decrease in both the age and the length at maturity is observed in this period and it seems likely that the age at maturity of female cod became fixed at around age 3 at the end of the period analysed.

Atlantic croaker are multiple spawners with asynchronous oocyte development and indeterminate fecundity. Mean length at first maturity for males and females was 182 and 173 mm TL, respectively. More than 85% of both sexes were mature by the end of their first year and all were mature by age 2. Spawning extends over a protracted period (July-December), but individual fish apparently spawn over a shorter interval. Eleven gravid and running-ripe females were collected within the Chesapeake Bay suggesting some spawning occurs in estuarine waters. Monthly sex ratios indicated a strong predominance of females during the main period of spawning. A high incidence of atretic, advanced yolked oocytes in spawning females collected throughout the spawning season suggests that a surplus production of yolked oocytes may be part of the reproductive strategy of Atlantic croaker.},

Evidence, mostly from salmonids, indicates that maturation is controlled by successive hormonal inhibition linked to energy state during critical periods of the year. Thus, any genetic selection cannot be acting upon the size of fish late in the reproductive cycle, but rather during the timing of these critical periods. Indeed, experimental studies demonstrate that size attained by late stages of gametogenesis need not necessarily be a good predictor of the probability of maturing. Therefore, changes in energy status around the time of maturation decisions represent an unknown and possibly significant source of variability in the reaction norm midpoints. Clearly, there is a need to apply physiologically realistic models of maturation probability—as have been developed for Atlantic salmon—to other fish species. Future investigation of fisheries-induced evolution may also benefit from examining historical changes in fecundity and by comparing current reproductive investment in fish from heavily and lightly exploited populations that are held under common-garden conditions.},

To provide new estimates of length- and age-at-maturity for central California halibut, we macroscopically examined gonads from 635 fish caught between 2012 and 2014 and additionally examined ovaries histologically. We developed a detailed description of the reproductive phases and spawning states for California halibut, and assigned sex-specific length- and age-at-maturity to each individual. Males (n=333) ranged from 19.1 to 95.9 cm fork length (FL) and 1 to 16 yr of age and females (n=302) ranged from 18.6 to 111.0 cm FL and 1 to 19 yr of age. Males matured at younger ages and shorter lengths than females. The smallest mature male was measured at 25.7 cm (1 yr), 50% of males were mature by 27.0 cm (1.1 yr), and 100% were mature by 29.0 cm (3 yr). The smallest mature female was measured at 46.6 cm (2 yr), 50% of females were mature by 47.3 cm (2.6 yr), and 100% were mature by 51.3 cm (4 yr), according to histological criteria. Therefore, all California halibut examined were mature before reaching the commercial and recreational minimum legal size limit of 55.9 cm (22 in). When comparing central California maturity data with information from southern California, we found that central California halibut matured at larger sizes (both sexes) and older ages (females only) than southern California halibut, according to macroscopic criteria.},

   abstract = {In ectotherms, growth rate, body size and maturation rate covary with temperature, with the direction and magnitude of variation predicted by the Temperature-Size Rule (TSR). Nutritional quality or availability of food, however, may vary over latitudinal gradients, resulting in ambiguous effects on body size and maturation rate. The Temperature-Constraint Hypothesis (TCH) predicts that marine herbivorous ectotherms are nutritionally compromised at latitudes exceeding 30°. This provides an opportunity to resolve the contrasting demographic responses of ectotherms to variation in temperature and nutritional status over latitudinal gradients. This study uses analysis of demographic rates to evaluate the predictions of the TSR in a marine herbivorous ectotherm sampled over a significant latitudinal gradient. The direction and magnitude of demographic variation was established in the marine herbivorous fish, Odax pullus (the butterfish), and compared with that of a phylogenetically related but trophically distinct species, the carnivorous Notolabrus fucicola (the banded wrasse). Both species were sampled at three locations across the length of New Zealand covering latitudes between 35°S and 49°S. Growth rate, mean size-at-age, age- and size-at-maturity, life span and abundance were estimated for each species at each location. Demographic traits of both taxa varied with latitude. Both species showed slower initial growth rates, and matured later at a larger body size at higher latitudes than populations sampled at lower latitudes. In addition, abundances increased significantly at higher latitudes in both species. These results were consistent with the TSR but not with the TCH, confirming that nutritional ecology (herbivore vs. carnivory) did not determine demographic patterns over a biologically significant latitudinal gradient. Results from this study suggest that the absence of herbivorous reef fishes from the higher latitudes of the Northern Hemisphere may not reflect a general physiological mechanism as suggested by the TCH and highlights the need to clarify the evolutionary histories of the marine biota of each hemisphere.},

   abstract = {We used two different approaches involving two organizational levels and spatial scales to explore altitudinal and latitudinal variation in life histories of non-anad- romous brown trout Salmo trutta. First, we studied the factors influencing the maturation of individuals from populations in northern Spain. Second, we explored the effects of altitude (range 40–1,340 m) and latitude (range 40.6–61.7?N) on longevity, maximum length, length and age at maturity, and fecundity, comparing Spanish and Norwegian populations. Individual maturation was determined by length, age, and sex, and at a given size and age individuals were more likely to mature at higher altitudes. Brown trout lived longer but attained smaller sizes at higher latitudes. Both males and females matured at an older age with increasing latitude, but latitude affected their life-history strategies differentially. Males matured at smaller sizes with increasing latitude and altitude, which may indicate that their maturation threshold depends on the growth potentiality of the river since they compete with other males from the same population. The opposite effects were detected in females. Since female fecundity increases strongly with size there may be a size below which maturation has strong fitness costs. Brown trout are extraordinarily plastic, allowing persistence in a wide variety of environments. In the context of climate change, latitudi- nally based studies are important to predict potential effects of climate change, especially at the southern edge of species distribution. Keywords},

   abstract = {This thesis deals with life-history variation in perch, with special focus on age at maturity. We conducted field studies to uncover the variation within short geographic distances and a literature review to study variation on a large geographic scale in order to reveal some factors affecting life-history. In two studies we discuss the relevance of predation risk and acidification, respectively, on age at maturity. With data from a large scale study (75 perch populations) covering a large range of the distribution area for perch we test life-history theory and optimality models. We found no effect of predation risk on age at maturity for five populations (3.6 4.5 years) in Northern Sweden, but predation risk was correlated with minimum size at maturity. There was no strong relationship between age at maturity in female perch and acidification in five lakes from southern Norway. However, age at maturity was lower for female perch from the most acidic lake (c. 2 years) compared with perch in the four other lakes (2.5 3.5 years). In the large scale study we found latitudinal effects on all life-history traits, except asymptotic body length. Generally, growth and mortality rates and reproductive investment decrease with latitude, whereas age and size at maturity and life span increased with latitude. There was a large variation in age at maturity with populations mean age at maturity span from 1 year in Lake Trasimeno in Italy southern Europe, to 6 years in Northern Yenisey in Siberia, Russia. Stunted (small-sized) populations had lower age and size at maturity and higher growth rate (K) compared to piscivorous populations. The life-history in southern populations with fast growth, high juvenile and adult mortality selects for early maturity and relatively large investment into reproduction. The opposite pattern was found for the northern populations. Roffs optimal age at maturity model gave good predictions for age at maturity in perch populations with data on growth and mortality rates. Mortality and age at maturity were negatively correlated, and growth coefficient (K) and age at maturity were also negatively correlated. In addition three other relationships showed invariance and all of them could therefore be termed as constants. Temperature differences, through latitude directly or indirectly, may to a large extent explain the variation found in life-history traits. In addition, different lifehistory trade-offs limit and constrains different traits. Reproduction constrains growth and survival. Age at maturity is constrained by the trade-off between growth and reproduction and the trade-off between survival and reproduction.},

   abstract = {Distinguishing management effects from the inherent variability in a system is a key consideration in assessing reserve efficacy. Here, we demonstrate how seascape heterogeneity, defined as the spatial configuration and composition of coral reef habitats, can mask our ability to discern reserve effects. We then test the application of a landscape approach, utilizing advances in benthic habitat mapping and GIS techniques, to quantify this heterogeneity and alleviate the confounding influence during reserve assessment. Seascape metrics were quantified at multiple spatial scales using a combination of spatial image analysis and in situ surveys at 87 patch reef sites in Glover's Reef Lagoon, Belize, within and outside a marine reserve enforced since 1998. Patch reef sites were then clustered into classes sharing similar seascape attributes using metrics that correlated significantly to observed variations in both fish and coral communities. When the efficacy of the marine reserve was assessed without including landscape attributes, no reserve effects were detected in the diversity and abundance of fish and coral communities, despite 10 years of management protection. However, grouping sites based on landscape attributes revealed significant reserve effects between site classes. Fish had higher total biomass (1.5x) and commercially important biomass (1.75x) inside the reserve and coral cover was 1.8 times greater inside the reserve, though direction and degree of response varied by seascape class. Our findings show that the application of a landscape classification approach vastly improves our ability to evaluate the efficacy of marine reserves by controlling for confounding effects of seascape heterogeneity and suggests that landscape heterogeneity should be considered in future reserve design.},

   abstract = {For the spear gun fishery at Glover's Reef, Belize, we used catch length frequencies to infer whether each of the eight most common species was likely to be overfished (spawning stock biomass<target) or experiencing overfishing (fishing mortality rate F>natural mortality rate M). We used Monte Carlo simulations to determine whether the results were sensitive to uncertainty about natural mortality, asymptotic length, growth rate and length at maturity. We found that black grouper Mycteroperca bonaci is overfished, and Nassau grouper Epinephelus striatus, schoolmaster snapper Lutjanus apodus and mutton snapper Lutjanus analis are probably overfished, but hogfish Lachnolaimus maximus, stoplight parrotfish Sparisoma viride, French angelfish Pomacanthus paru and gray angelfish Pomacanthus arcuatus are probably not overfished. All species except French angelfish were experiencing overfishing across a range of life history parameters. Nassau grouper, black grouper and mutton snapper were often caught below the size at maturity Lm. The results were sensitive to different assumed values of the life history parameters. Life history parameters can vary regionally for many reef fishes, and there have been few life history studies in the western Caribbean; such studies would greatly improve estimates of stock status. We also calculated six multispecies indicators of fishery status. The mean length relative to Lmwas greater than 1.0 and constant between 2005 and 2011. Mean trophic level, mean maximum size, and fraction piscivores increased between 2005 and 2011, partly due to the fact that parrotfish, previously an important component of the catch, have been prohibited beginning in 2009. Mean catch per unit effort declined. Given that black grouper, Nassau grouper, mutton snapper and schoolmaster snapper are found to be overfished and experiencing overfishing under most values of the life history parameters, we recommend size or catch limits for these species. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

Current strength was highest at both the northern and southern ends of the atoll and largely controlled by local wind and weakly by tidal forcing. Benthic functional group distributions varied throughout the atoll and had distinct areas of dominance. In contrast, dominance of coral species was weaker, reflecting the lost cover and zonation of Acropora, Porites, and Montastraea that were reported in the 1970s. Hard and soft corals dominated the windward rim, while the central and leeward lagoon had lower current strengths and sea grass and fleshy green algae were relatively more abundant. Brown erect algae were relatively more common in the north and calcifying green and red algae the southern ends of the atoll. Only Montastraea-Agaricia agaricites distributions were similar to reports from the 1970s with high relative dominance in the southern and northeast atoll. The central-northern zone, which was described as an Acropora zone in the 1970s, was not recognizable, and Porites porites, P. astreoides, Millepora alcicornis, and Favia fragum were the most abundant species during this survey. Hard and soft coral cover abundance declined away from the reef rim and tidal channels and was associated with fast seawater turnover and high surgeonfish abundance. Consequently, the windward rim area has retained the most original and persistent hard-soft coral and surgeonfish community and is considered a priority for future management, if the goal is to protect coral from fishing impacts.},

   abstract = {No-take marine reserves have been used to promote biodiversity conservation and have increasingly been implemented with the goal of rebuilding depleted fish stocks. Yet, marine reserves may cause some species to decrease in abundance while others increase, in part because species are not equally impacted by the effort displaced from the reserve into surrounding fished areas. We evaluate temporal patterns in the abundance and distribution of reef fishes at Glover’s Atoll, Belize, where a no-take reserve was enforced in 1998. For the set of commercial species investigated in our study, the most important variable in predicting species responses to reserve protection was the pre-reserve spatial distribution of fishes with respect to reserve boundaries. Variation in species responses to protection could not be attributed to benthic habitat degradation, but maximum body length and trophic level were both positively correlated with response to protection. We suggest that reserve implementation caused mortality rates to increase for some fish species that were originally distributed in higher abundances outside reserve boundaries, leading to declines in abundance in these populations. These findings highlight the importance of incorporating knowledge on spatial distributions of fishes when designing and monitoring marine reserves. Our methods can be used by reserve managers to predict the responses of individual species to protection at the time of reserve implementation, thereby facilitating agreement between the expectations of fishery managers and the needs of stakeholders.},

   abstract = {We investigated the effects of marine reserve protection on fish and benthic communities at Glover's Reef Marine Reserve, Belize, using a broad suite of indicators. Responses of fish species to protection were highly variable, and therefore indicators calculated at the fish community level were ambiguous. According to 11 of 13 community-level indicators, sites located within the no-take zone fared more poorly over time than did sites in the surrounding fished area. However, we were able to detect positive reserve effects using a newly-proposed pair of indicators, which take into account spatial distribution of different species at the time of the no-take zone implementation. These indicators showed that species subject to low fishing pressure increased inside and to a lesser extent outside the no-take zone, while species subject to higher levels of fishing pressure increased in the no-take zone but decreased in the fished area. Indicators of changes in the fish community were not correlated with those related to the benthic community, and we suggest that indicators be carefully selected to match management objectives. We also find that positive reserve effects based on present-day data (e.g., higher abundances of commercial species inside the no-take zone versus outside) were often not associated with increases in fish densities over time, and suggest caution when interpreting abundance patterns in the absence of historical data. We recommend that similar studies be carried out at a variety of reserve sites, to test our proposed indicators and increase our understanding of community-level responses to fisheries closures. © 2014 Published by Elsevier Ltd.},

Surveys of 87 patch reefs inside and outside the reserve revealed no clear indication of reserve implementation benefitting coral cover, coral colony size, or abundance of juvenile corals. Furthermore, massive broadcasting coral species exhibited greater losses over time than their smaller-sized counterparts across all sites, suggesting that local management actions have not alleviated the regional trend of high mortality for these species. We detected no difference in herbivorous fish abundances or macroalgal cover between reserve and fished sites, providing a potential explanation for the lack of cascading positive effects on the coral community. We conclude that patterns of regional coral decline are evident at Glover's Reef, including a shift in dominance from broadcasting species to brooding species and declines in mean colony size. Our findings suggest that regional stressors are overwhelming local management efforts and that additional strategies are required to improve local coral condition.},

It is recognized that adult and juvenile movement reduces the core benefits of protected areas, namely pro-tecting the full age–structure of marine populations, while at the same time perhaps improving fisheries yield over the no-reserve situation through export of individuals from protected areas. Nevertheless, the study of the consequences of movement on protected area functioning is unbalanced. Significant atten-tion has been paid to the influence of certain movement patterns, such as diffusive movement and home ranges, while the impacts of others, such as density-dependent movements and ontogenetic migrations, have been relatively ignored. Here we review the diversity of density-independent and density-dependent movement patterns, as well as what is currently known about their consequences for the con-servation and fisheries effects of marine protected areas. We highlight a number of 'partially addressed' issues in marine protected area research, such as the effects of reserves targeting specific life phases, and a number of essentially unstudied issues, such as density-dependent movements, nomadism, ontogenetic migrations, behavioral polymorphism and 'dynamic' reserves that adjust location as a realtime response to habitat changes. Assessing these issues will be essential to creating effective marine protected area networks for mobile species and accurately assessing reserve impacts on these species.},

If individuals inside reserves behave differently to those outside, this information should be incorporated into reserve design and in management efforts to avoid the selective removal of certain behaviors. We used acoustic telemetry to monitor the movements of the sparid Pagrus auratus (snapper) inside and outside a marine reserve (the Leigh Marine Reserve, northeastern New Zealand). We tagged 39 snapper within an array of acoustic receivers that encompassed reserve and fished areas. Nineteen snapper were resident over a 5-month period; the remainder either left the array or died. Residential fish expressed two home range types. One group had uni-modal home ranges that on average encompassed c.900 m linear distance. All nine residential snap-per from the reserve displayed this behavior, as well as five of ten residential fish from the non-reserve area. The second group (five fish, all from the non-reserve area) had home ranges with two separate modes (bi-modal home ranges), which on average encompassed c.2 100 m linear distance. We suggest that some aspect of the marine reserve environment encourages extreme residency by either the modification of individual behaviors or through the removal of selective exploitation. If true this suggests that reserves and populations of exploited animals may become dependent on the life history characteristics of the individuals they encourage or select for.},

Most coastal and estuarine fisheries resources are either fully exploited or overexploited due to the involvement of increased number of fishermen, employment of more efficient fishing gears and adoption of mechanization. The present study elucidates trophic level status of fish resources exploited from Vembanad lake, S. India as an indicator of fishery-induced impacts in food web structure and thereby delineating its usefulness in describing the state of fisheries in this ecologically fragile ecosystem. Results showed that fishery resources of Vembanad lake has dwindled considerably from 115 species contributing 3068.29 tonnes during 1987-1988 to 80 species constituting 1192 tonnes during 2012-2013. The species richness has reduced to 3.78 in latter period from 6.40 in former period. A perceptible variation in composition of trophic groups was also observed in exploited fishery resources of the two periods. The number of species representing herbivores-omnivores-detritivores (Trophic Level-2.0-2.99) reduced from 31 to 28, mid-level carnivores (Trophic Level-3.0-3.99) from to 66 to 43 and the same of high-level carnivores from 18 to 9 species. Chi-square test revealed significant (p<0.05) difference in reduction of both mid-level carnivores and total species exploited from the lake. Large marine migrant predators, which showed predominance during 1987-1988, declined along with a significant influx of freshwater and lower trophic fishes in fish catch of 2012-13. The significant reduction in the diversity of fishes represented in exploited fishery bring about theories like 'fishing down the food web' and 'top down effect' and change in ecology of the lake. These ecological changes are brought about by a combination of natural as well as anthropogenic causes which demand continuous monitoring of fish catch in order to ascertain the ecosystem health of Vembanad lake.},

   abstract = {A loss of large vertebrates has occurred in aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems, but data to measure long-term population changes are sparse. Historical photographs provide visual and quantitative evidence of changes in mean individual size and species composition for groups of marine fish that have been targeted by sport fishing. I measured such trends for 13 groups of recreationally caught "trophy" reef fish with photographs taken in Key West, Florida, from 1956 to 2007. The mean fish size declined from an estimated 19.9 kg (SE 1.5) to 2.3 kg (SE 0.3), and there was a major shift in species composition. Landings from 1956 to 1960 were dominated by large groupers (Epinephelus spp.), and other large predatory fish were commonly caught, including sharks with an average length of just <2 m. In contrast, landings in 2007 were composed of small snappers (Lutjanus spp. and Ocyurus chrysurus) with an average length of 34.4 cm (SE 0.62), and the average length of sharks declined by more than 50% over 50 years. Major declines in the size of fish caught were not reflected in the price of fishing trips, so customers paid the same amount for a less-valuable product. Historical photographs provide a window into a more pristine coral reef ecosystem that existed a half a century ago and lend support to current observations that unfished reef communities are able to support large numbers of large-bodied fish. Documentación de la Pérdida de Peces de Trofeo en los Cayos de Florida con Fotografías Históricas Resumen: Una pérdida de vertebrados mayores ha ocurrido en ecosistemas acuáticos y terrestres, pero los datos para medir los cambios poblaciones a largo plazo son escasos. Las fotografías históricas proporcionan evidencia visual y cuantitativa de cambios en el tamaño individual promedio y de la composición de especies en grupos de peces marinos que han sido blanco de la pesca deportiva. Medí esas tendencias en 13 grupos de peces de arrecife capturados recreativamente como "trofeos" mediante fotografías tomadas en Key West, Florida, desde 1956 a 2007. El peso promedio de los peces declinó de unos 19.9 kg (ES 1.5) a 2.3 kg (ES 0.3), y hubo un cambio mayor en la composición de especies. Las capturas entre 1956 y 1960 estuvieron dominadas por meros (Epinephelus spp.) grandes, y otros peces depredadores eran capturados comúnmente, incluyendo tiburones con una longitud promedio de poco menos de 2m. En contraste, las capturas en 2007 fueron compuestas de pargos (Lutjanus spp. y Ocyurus chrysurus) pequeños con una longitud promedio de 34.4 cm (ES 0.62), y la longitud promedio de los tiburones declinó más de 50% en 50 años. La gran declinación en el tamaño de los peces capturados no se reflejó en los precios de los viajes de pesca, así que los clientes pagaron la misma cantidad por un producto menos valioso. Las fotografías históricas proporcionan una visión de un ecosistema arrecifal coralino prístino que existió hace medio siglo y proporcionan soporte a los comentarios actuales de que las comunidades arrecifales no explotadas son capaces de soportar numerosos peces de talla grande.},

   abstract = {2 EXECUTIVE SUMMARY The decline of bonefish (Albula vulpes) throughout the Florida Keys, particularly in Florida Bay which historically was an epicenter of the Florida bonefishery, is a tremendous concern due to their status as an indicator species and the importance of the fishery for the Keys' economy. This study utilized a bottom-up trophic approach, examining the bonefish prey base as a possible cause of the population decline. Specifically, the goals of this 1-year study were to compare patterns of bonefish abundance using available data, and to examine spatial (regional) and temporal (decadal) variation in benthic fauna communities of the Florida Keys to determine the extent that prey abundance may influence bonefish abundance and distribution. Trends in bonefish abundance were assessed using a 19-question questionnaire that targeted known, experienced Florida Bay fishers (conducted independent of this study, 2010-2012). Prey sampling was conducted three times in 2012 (March, July and October) at five study sites: Cross Bank, Buchanan Bank and 9-Mile Bank in the Upper Keys, Sands Cut in Biscayne Bay, and Sawyer Keys in the Lower Keys. Benthic and canopy-dwelling fish and invertebrates were collected using 1-m 2 throw traps, modeling sampling design and protocols after those of Powell et al. (1987) who described fish and decapod communities in Florida Bay in the 1980s (repeated by Matheson et al. (1999) in the 1990s). Seagrass beds at each site were characterized using 15.3-cm diameter cores and estimates of cover during each sampling event. Comparisons were made of seagrass characteristics and community structure, abundance and biomass of fish and invertebrates among sites, and with collections made in the 1980s and 1990s at Cross and Buchanan. Key Findings:  The Lower Keys had the least reported overall decline in bonefish and the highest abundance of bonefish prey and other invertebrates, while the Upper Keys/Florida Bay had the greatest reported overall decline in bonefish and a lower abundance of bonefish prey and other invertebrates.  Cross Bank and 9-Mile Bank had tremendous intra-annual (seasonal) variation in benthic prey community structure and low prey abundance compared to all other sites. The prey community (structure and standing stock) at Buchanan Bank was more similar to that of Biscayne Bay than to the other Upper Keys sites.  No discernible relationship was observed between seagrass abundance and benthic prey abundance, as Sawyer (Lower Keys) had the least seagrass and the highest prey abundance, while Cross Bank had the most seagrass and the lowest prey abundance.  While our data indicate lower bonefish prey abundance at two of the three Upper Keys/Florida Bay sites, relative to other regions, decadal comparisons do not suggest benthic prey abundance at these sites decreased to a great extent (if at all) over the last three decades. These findings suggest it is unlikely that prey limitation is the primary cause of the recent decline in the Florida Bay bonefish population. We suggest other factors that may also be contributing to the bonefish decline in Florida Bay. CONTENTS},

   abstract = {We present a model of the effects of a marine reserve on spawning stock biomass (SSB) and short-and long-term yield for a size-structured species that exhibits seasonal movements. The model considers the effects of protecting nursery and (or) spawning grounds under a range of fishing mortalities and fish mobility rates. We consider two extremes of effort redistribution following reserve establishment and analyze the effects of a reserve when the fishery targets either mature or immature fish. We apply the model to the Mediterranean hake (Merluccius merluccius) and show that a marine reserve could be highly beneficial for this species. We demonstrate benefits from reserves not just for overexploited stocks of low-mobility species, but also (to a lesser extent) for underexploited stocks and high-mobility species. Greatly increased resilience to overfishing is also found in the majority of cases. We show that a reserve provides benefits additional to those obtained from simple effort control. Benefits from reserves depend to a major extent on the amount of effort redistribution following reserve establishment and on fishing selectivity; hence, these factors should be key components of any evaluation of reserve effectiveness. Résumé : On trouvera ici un modèle qui décrit les effets d'une réserve marine sur la biomasse du stock des reproduc-teurs et sur les rendements à court et à long termes chez une espèce à structure de taille définie qui fait des déplace-ments saisonniers. Le modèle examine les effets de la protection des zones d'alevinage et (ou) de fraye sur une gamme de mortalités dues à la pêche et de taux de mobilité des poissons. Nous considérons deux extrêmes dans la redistribution de l'effort de pêche à la suite de l'établissement d'une réserve et nous analysons les effets de la réserve quand la pêche cible les poissons immatures ou alors les poissons adultes. Nous appliquons le modèle au merlu commun (Merluccius merluccius) et démontrons qu'une réserve marine lui serait très bénéfique. Les bénéfices d'une réserve s'appliquent non seulement aux stocks surexploités d'espèces à mobilité réduite, mais aussi, bien que dans une plus faible mesure, aux stocks sous-exploités et aux espèces très mobiles. Dans la majorité des cas, il existe aussi une résilience fortement accrue à la surpêche. La réserve apporte des bénéfices additionnels à ceux que génère le simple contrôle de l'effort de pêche. Ces bénéfices dépendent en grande partie de l'importance de la redistribution de l'effort de pêche après l'établissement de la réserve et de la sélectivité de la pêche; ces facteurs devraient donc être les éléments essentiels de toute évaluation de l'efficacité d'une réserve.

   abstract = {A substantial shift toward use of marine protected areas (MPAs) for conservation and fisheries management is currently underway. This shift to explicit spatial management presents new challenges and uncertainties for ecologists and resource managers. In particular, the potential for MPAs to change population sustainability, fishery yield, and ecosystem properties depends on the poorly understood consequences of three critical forms of connectivity over space: larval dispersal, juvenile and adult swimming, and movement of fishermen. Conventional fishery management describes the dynamics and current status of fish populations, with increasing recent emphasis on sustainability, often through reference points that reflect individual replacement. These compare lifetime egg production (LEP) to a critical replacement threshold (CRT) whose value is uncertain. Sustainability of spatially distributed populations also depends on individual replacement, but through all possible paths created by larval dispersal and LEP at each location. Model calculations of spatial replacement considering larval connectivity alone indicate sustainability and yield depend on species dispersal distance and the distribution of LEP created by species habitat distribution and fishing mortality. Adding MPAs creates areas with high LEP, increasing sustainability, but not necessarily yield. Generally, short distance dispersers will persist in almost all MPAs, while sustainability of long distance dispersers requires a specific density of MPAs along the coast. The value of that density also depends on the uncertain CRT, as well as fishing rate. MPAs can increase yield in areas with previously low LEP but for short distance dispersers, high yields will require many small MPAs. The paucity of information on larval dispersal distances, especially in cases with strong advection, renders these projections uncertain. Adding juvenile and adult movement to these calculations reduces LEP near the edges in MPAs, if movement is within a home-range, but more broadly over space if movement is diffusive. Adding movement of fishermen shifts effort on the basis of anticipated revenues and fishing costs, leading to lower LEP near ports, for example. Our evolving understanding of connectivity in spatial management could form the basis for a new, spatially oriented replacement reference point for sustainability, with associated new uncertainties.},

   abstract = {Fish spillover Marine reserves Fisheries A B S T R A C T Marine protected areas (MPAs) are considered as an effective tool in marine coastal management , and considered able to enhance local fisheries through adult fish spillover. Indirect evidence of fish spillover could be obtained by horizontal gradients in fish abundance. To address this question, the existence of gradients of fish abundance and biomass across marine reserve boundaries was assessed in six Mediterranean MPAs using underwater visual censuses performed at various distances from the core of the MPA, in integral reserve (IR), to buffer zone (BZ) and fished areas. A reserve effect was evidenced with higher values of fish species richness (·1.1), abundance (·1.3), and biomass (·4.7) recorded inside MPAs compared to adjacent fished areas. Linear correlations revealed significant negative gradients in mean fish biomass in all the reserves studied after the effect of habitat had been removed, whereas negative gradients in abundance were less conspicuous. Generalized additive models suggested two main patterns of biomass gradients, with a sharp decrease at the IR-BZ boundary or at the BZ-fished area boundary. It was estimated that fish spillover beneficial to local fisheries occurred mostly at a small spatial scale (100s of metres). The existence of regular patterns of negative fish biomass gradients from within MPAs to fished areas was consistent with the hypothesis of adult fish biomass spillover processes from marine reserves and could be considered as a general pattern in this Mediter-ranean region.},

   abstract = {Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) are known to contribute toward the conservation of marine biodiversity, particularly targeted fishery species. Snapper Chrysophrys auratus are an important recreational and commercial fish species in New South Wales (NSW), Australia, and despite fishery management for this species, they are considered "growth overfished" in this region. To assess how C. auratus respond to the implementation of an MPA with several no-take and partially protected areas in temperate NSW, we monitored their populations over a decade (2006-2017) using baited remote underwater video systems (BRUVs). Surveys were conducted in the Port Stephens-Great Lakes Marine Park with BRUVs deployed on rocky reefs in depths of 20-50 m. Long term seasonal sampling (winter vs. summer) was undertaken at two locations (Broughton and Fingal Island), and changes in C. auratus abundance prior to, and 8 years after zoning implementation, were assessed between these two locations. In total, we sampled five no-take areas within the marine park and five comparative nearby partially protected fished areas and three sites located outside the marine park boundaries. The most pronounced changes in abundance and size structure for C. auratus were observed in the Broughton Island no-take area where numbers increased almost 3-fold (2.91 times) over 8 years of protection. Relative abundance showed seasonal variation at two locations, and we consistently recorded increasing abundance within no-take areas at Broughton and Fingal Island compared to nearby sites open to fishing. Surveys across the five no-take areas found a significant increase in the abundance of C. auratus, whilst the five partially-protected locations in the marine park still recorded higher abundances than sites outside the marine park. In addition, length measurements from stereo-BRUVS indicated that C. auratus were significantly larger in no-take areas compared to partially-protected areas in the marine park and sites outside the marine park. This study demonstrates how the implementation of the marine park and the protection afforded by no-take and partially-protected areas provides refuge for this important fishery targeted species.},

   abstract = {A brackish water ecotone of coastal bays and lakes, mangrove forests, salt marshes, tidal creeks, and upland hammocks separates Florida Bay, Biscayne Bay, and the Gulf of Mexico from the freshwater Everglades. The Everglades mangrove estuaries are characterized by salinity gradients that vary spatially with topography and vary seasonally and inter-annually with rainfall, tide, and freshwater flow from the Everglades. Because of their location at the lower end of the Everglades drainage basin, Everglades mangrove estuaries have been affected by upstream water management practices that have altered the freshwater heads and flows and that affect salinity gradients. Additionally, interannual variation in precipitation patterns, particularly those caused to El Niño events, control freshwater inputs and salinity dynamics in these estuaries. Two major external drivers on this system are water management activities and global climate change. These drivers lead to two major ecosystem stressors: reduced freshwater flow volume and duration, and sea-level rise. Major ecological attributes include mangrove forest production, soil accretion, and resilience; coastal lake submerged aquatic vegetation; resident mangrove fish populations; wood stork (Mycteria americana) and roseate spoonbill (Platelea ajaja) nesting colonies; and estuarine crocodilian populations. Causal linkages between stressors and attributes include coastal transgression, hydroperiods, salinity gradients, and the ''white zone'' freshwater/estuarine interface. The functional estuary and its ecological attributes, as influenced by sea level and freshwater flow, must be viewed as spatially dynamic, with a possible near-term balancing of transgression but ultimately a long-term continuation of inland movement. Regardless of the spatio-temporal timing of this transgression, a salinity gradient supportive of ecologically functional Everglades mangrove estuaries will be required to maintain the integrity of the South Florida ecosystem.},

   abstract = {In southern Florida, a vast network of canals and water control structures mediate freshwater discharge into the coastal zone. Management protocol for one such canal network (C-I 11) is being modified in part to try to improve habitat for estuarine fish and wading birds in northeastern Florida Bay, an estuarine part of Everglades National Park. Changes in canal management could alter the spatial and temporal salinity regime in the estuary. To better predict the effect of such changes on estuarine habitat, abundances of submersed vegetation and benthic animals were sampled repeatedly at 12 stations that differed in salinity. A variety of other parameters were also measured (nutrients, light, temperature, oxygen, sediment characteristics, and others). Mean salinity among stations ranged from 11.4%o to 33.1~'m Densities of benthic plants and animals differed among stations by several orders of magnitude. The standard deviation of salinity was the best environmental correlate with mean plant biomass and benthic animal density: less biota occurred at stations with greater fluctuations in salinity. The two stations with the least plant blomass also had the highest mean water temperatures. In a stepwise multiple regression analysis, standard deviation of salinity accounted for 59% of the variation in the logarithm of mean plant biomass among stations. For every 3%0 increase in the standard deviation, total benthic plant biomass decreased by an order of magnitude. Mean water temperature accounted for only 14% of the variation, and mean salinity was not included for lack of significance. At stations with widely fluctuating salinities, not only was biomass low, but species dominance also frequently changed. Severe fluctuation in salinity may have prevented abundant benthos by causing physiological stress that reduced growth and survival. Salinity may not have remained within the range of tolerance of any one plant species for long enough to allow the development of a substantially vegetated benthic community. Hence, gaining control over salinity fluctuation may be the key to estuarine habitat improvement through canal management in southern Florida.},

Site fidelity, habitat use, and home range size were assessed for 29 adult eastern blue gropers monitored for up to 374 days using passive acoustic telemetry within and around a small marine reserve. 4. The fish exhibited long residency times and no movement was recorded between adjacent reefs, suggesting sand acts as a natural barrier to movement. 5. Core ranges were calculated using 50% kernel utilization distributions (KUD) and estimated between 0.005 and 0.092 km 2. Males had larger core ranges than females or fish of indeterminate sex. There was no statistical difference between the breeding/non-breeding seasons. 6. Home ranges were calculated using 95% KUD and ranged between 0.03 and 0.54 km 2. Home range size was largest for males and significantly larger for all sexes in the breeding season. Fish tagged in the 'no-take' area of the MPA had smaller home ranges than fish tagged in the area where fishing is permitted. 7. This study indicates that even relatively small MPAs can provide effective protection for adult eastern blue groper, supporting the proposition that large reef dwellers with long residency times can be used as flagship species to gain public support for the designation of MPAs.},

Sites were selected to take advantage of the spatial variability in phosphorus (P) availability and salinity climates across the bay. Aboveground biomass and NPP of T. testudinum were determined five to six times annually. Short-shoot demography , belowground biomass, and belowground NPP were assessed from a single destructive harvest at each site and short-shoot cohorts were estimated from leaf scar counts multiplied by site-specific leaf production rates. Biomass, relative growth rate (RGR), and overall NPP were positively correlated with P availability. Additionally, a positive correlation between P availability and the ratio of photosynthetic to non-photosynthetic biomass suggests that T. testudinum increases allocation to aboveground biomass as P availability increases. Population turnover increased with P availability, evident in positive correlations of recruitment and mortality rates with P availability. Departures from seasonally modeled estimates of RGR were found to be influenced by salinity, which depressed RGR when below 20 psu or above 40 psu. Freshwater management in the headwaters of Florida Bay will alter salinity and nutrient climates. It is becoming clear that such changes will affect T. testudinum, with likely feedbacks on ecosystem structure, function, and habitat quality.},

   abstract = {1. The use of marine reserves as tools either for conservation or fisheries management requires rigorous empirical evidence for the recovery of exploited species within them. 2. The relative density and size structure of snapper Pagrus auratus (Sparidae), an intensively exploited reef fish species, were measured, using baited underwater video, inside and outside three northern New Zealand marine reserves (Leigh Marine Reserve, Hahei Marine Reserve and Tawharanui Marine Park) every 6 months from October 1997 to April 1999. 3. Log-linear modelling showed that relative total density and egg production of snapper were higher in all three reserves than in fished areas. Snapper that were larger than the minimum legal size were estimated to be 14 times denser in protected areas than in fished areas, and the relative egg production was estimated to be 18 times higher. In the Leigh reserve, legal-size snapper were larger than legal-size snapper in fished areas. 4. At the Leigh reserve, snapper density consistently peaked at the reserve centre and declined towards either boundary, which suggests that snapper became increasingly vulnerable to fishing towards the reserve boundaries. 5. Inshore snapper density was significantly higher in autumn than in spring, supporting previous suggestions that snapper make regular onshore-offshore seasonal migrations that might be related to spawning. We suggest that the observed recovery of snapper populations within reserves is attributable to immigration of individuals from fished areas that take up residency within reserves, rather than juvenile recruitment. 6. Synthesis and applications. This study demonstrates the effectiveness of marine reserves for protecting an exploited species previously thought to be too mobile to respond to area-based protection. Although it is difficult to envisage significant enhancement of fished areas via adult emigration, it is likely that the reserves contribute significantly to local gamete production. In addition, the protection of fish populations within reserves might slow reductions in genetic diversity caused by size-selective mortality brought about by exploitation.},

   abstract = {New Zealand pioneered marine reserves, areas in the sea protected from all direct human interference. The first reserve was proposed in 1965 and established in 1977. It has operated successfully ever since. Even one instance proves that such things are possible. All marine reserves in NZ were initially greeted by a range of objections, and widespread and often loud opposition, This is not surprising since marine reserves prohibit many existing activities and seriously challenge many general opinions. Such opposition is to be expected. Successful establishment of marine reserves in the first stage was only possible when the proponents were very persistent and had community support. It helped if they could take advantage of some special local circumstance e.g. an adjacent marine laboratory (Leigh), spectacular underwater scenery (Poor Knights), unique biogeography (Kermadecs), cultural significance (Mayor Island), or severe fishery problems (Long Bay). Careful examination of the objections to marine reserves showed that they were mostly based on misconceptions or misinformation, and can be successfully countered in the public mind by answers based on common sense arguments or well-established facts. Developing these answers, and testing them in the public arena, proved surprisingly useful in both scientific theory and practical politics. When marine reserves were established, their ecology began to change, due to the cessation of fishing and other previous manipulations. These changes were complex, often large and continued to develop for decades. The study of these changes, and a continuing comparison to fished areas provided a great deal of new scientific data showing how fishing directly and indirectly alters ecosystems. The scientific benefits of marine reserves proved so numerous that it became clear that marine reserves are as important to science as clean apparatus is to chemistry, and for the same reason. They are the controls for the uncontrolled experiment that is happening due to fishing and other human activities. The general benefits of marine reserves to society as a whole; directly to conservation, education, recreation and management, and indirectly to fisheries, tourism and coastal planning; are so important that a systematic approach to their creation is in the public interest. The experience with existing marine reserves (35 to date) is sufficient to state the principles needed for such systems: representation and Replication (of habitats and species); a geographically widespread network; and a total area sufficient to be self-sustaining. Most of the lessons from New Zealand are based on fundamental human and ecological factors and would be applicable world-wide. Other regions could by-pass the long struggle that occurred in New Zealand and move directly to creating marine reserve network systems based on our experiences and these principles. This has already started to happen in Australia and the USA.},

From 2008 to 2014, an ROV was deployed to track the at-sea behavior of loggerhead turtles in the Northwest Atlantic Ocean. Seventy turtles were tracked, totaling 44.7 h of direct turtle footage. For all attempts, usable video with a turtle retained in view for a minimum of 30 s, was produced at a rate of 43.5% of effort. Turtles were first spotted from the boat, and then when the turtle was within ~50 m of the boat, the ROV was deployed to track the turtle for as long as possible. Tracking durations reached up to 426.1 min. Tracked turtles often remained within ~10 m of the surface; however loggerheads were tracked to the seafloor on 12 occasions. Turtles were filmed foraging both pelagically and benthically, even though bottom temperatures reached as low as 7.1 °C. A range of inter-and intra-species interactions were also captured. Several varieties of fish remained associated with individual turtles for extended periods of time, even during benthic foraging dives. Additionally, a variety of social interactions between loggerheads were documented. Generally these interactions were filmed occurring near the ocean surface. Overall, using the ROV provided great insight into loggerhead at-sea behavior, otherwise unattainable using previously established techniques.},

   abstract = {Marine reserves are the primary management tool for Guam's reef fish fishery. While a build-up of fish biomass has occurred inside reserve boundaries, it is unknown whether reserve size matches the scale of movement of target species. Using passive acoustic telemetry, we quantified movement patterns and home range size of two heavily exploited unicornfish Naso unicornis and Naso lituratus. Fifteen fish (N. unicornis: n = 7; N. lituratus: n = 4 male, n = 4 female) were fitted with internal acoustic tags and tracked continuously over four months within a remote acoustic receiver array located in a decade-old marine reserve. This approach provided robust estimates of unicornfish movement patterns and home range size. The mean home range of 3.2 ha for N. unicornis was almost ten times larger than that previously recorded from a three-week tracking study of the species in Hawaii. While N. lituratus were smaller in body size, their mean home range (6.8 ha) was over twice that of N. unicornis. Both species displayed strong site fidelity, particularly during nocturnal and cre-puscular periods. Although there was some overlap, individual movement patterns and home range size were highly variable within species and between sexes. N. unicornis home range increased with body size, and only the three largest fish home ranges extended into the deeper outer reef slope beyond the shallow reef flat. Both Naso species favoured habitat dominated by corals. Some individuals made predictable daily crepuscular migrations between different locations or habitat types. There was no evidence of significant spillover from the marine reserve into adjacent fished areas. Strong site fidelity coupled with negligible spillover suggests that small-scale reserves, with natural habitat boundaries to emigration, are effective in protecting localized unicornfish populations.},

However, such approaches are hindered by challenges in aligning data types, communicating across disciplines, and applying social science information to conservation actions. To meet these challenges, we propose a conceptual model that adopts a social-ecological systems approach and integrates social and ecological theory to identify the multiple, nested levels of influence on both human and animal behavior. By accounting for a diverse array of influences and feedback mechanisms between social and ecological systems, this model fulfills a need for approaches that treat social and ecological processes with equal depth and facilitates a comprehensive understanding of the drivers of human and animal behaviors that perpetuate human-wildlife interactions. We apply this conceptual model to our work on human-black bear conflicts in Colorado, USA to demonstrate its utility. Using this example, we identify key lessons and offer guidance to researchers and conservation practitioners for applying integrated approaches to other human-wildlife systems.},

to coral reef fishes has been the difficulty of disentangling its
effects from other subtidal/nearshore habitats or human population
pressures. Florida's seascape, unlike most others, has been extensively
surveyed and mapped, and there are reliable estimates of human
population density. Despite many studies that have correlated reef fish
abundance with nearby mangrove habitat, some researchers continue to
question the importance of mangroves to reef fishes. Previous studies
that have investigated the mangrove-reef fish subsidy effect have
applied methods that either compared averages or examined linear
relationships; yet there is a body of literature that indicates that the
effects of habitat are characterized by thresholds and limiting
functions. Here, we employed a generalized additive model to investigate
whether species richness of 106 mangrove-associated reef fishes is
related to thresholds in the extent of nearby mangrove forests along the
Florida Keys Reef Tract. In addition, we used linear discriminant
analyses (LDAs) to examine the relationships between the occurrence of
77 reef fish species and extent of Florida mangrove forests. We found
that after accounting for confounding factors, at scales <20 km(2),
species richness declines with decreasing mangrove extent, whereas
richness increases with increasing mangrove extent at scales >80 km(2).
Results of our LDA suggested that at least 49 reef fish species (64% of
focal species) were associated with higher nearby mangrove forest
extent. Our results indicate that of all habitat attributes considered,
mangroves played the most substantial role in the diversity of nearby
reef fish populations. These apparent thresholds (i.e., non-linearities)
in the extent of mangrove forests should be incorporated into fisheries
critical habitat management and emphasize the need to consider
non-linear relationships between fishes and their habitat.},

Most work so far has focused on selection pressures on life history traits and body size as morphological trait. We studied here how recreational fishing selects for morphological traits related to body shape, which may correlate with underlying swimming behavior. Using landmark-based geometric morphometrics, we found consistent recreational fishing-induced selection pressures on body shape in two recreationally exploited marine fish species. We show that individuals with larger-sized mouths and more streamlined and elongated bodies were more vulnerable to passively operated hook-and-line fishing independent of the individual's body size or condition. While the greater vulnerability of individuals with larger mouth gapes can be explained by the direct physical interaction with hooks, selection against streamlined and elongated individuals could either involve a specific foraging mode or relate to underlying elevated swimming behavior. Harvesting using passive gear is common around the globe, and thus, size-independent selection on body shape is expected to be widespread potentially leaving behind individuals with smaller oral gapes and more compact bodies. This might have repercussions for food webs by altering foraging and predation. 2154},

   abstract = {No-take marine protected areas (MPAs) are assumed to enhance fisheries catch via the "spillover" effect, where biomass is exported to adjacent exploited areas. Recent studies in spearfishing fisheries suggest that the spillover of gear-naïve individuals from protected to unprotected sites increases catch rates outside the boundaries of MPAs. Whether this is a widespread phenomenon that also holds for other gear types and species is unknown. In this study, we tested if the distance to a Mediterranean MPA predicted the degree of vulnerability to hook and line in four small-bodied coastal fish species. With the assistance of underwater video recording, we investigated the interaction effect of the distance to the boundary of an MPA and species type relative to the latency time to ingest a natural bait, which was considered as a surrogate of fish naïveté or vulnerability to fishing. Vulnerability to angling increased (i.e., latency time decreased) within and near the boundary of an MPA for an intrinsically highly catchable species (Serranus scriba), while it remained constant for an intrinsically uncatchable control species (Chromis chromis). While all of the individuals of S. scriba observed within the MPA and surrounding areas were in essence captured by angling gear, only one fifth of individuals in the far locations were captured. This supports the potential for the spillover of gear-naïve and consequently more vulnerable fish from no-take MPAs. Two other species initially characterized as intermediately catchable (Coris julis and Diplodus annularis) also had a shorter latency time in the vicinity of an MPA, but for these two cases the trend was not statistically significant. Overall, our results suggest that an MPA-induced naïveté effect may not be universal and may be confined to only intrinsically highly catchable fish species. This fact emphasizes the importance of considering the behavioural dimension when predicting the outcomes of MPAs, otherwise the PLOS ONE |},

   abstract = {Decadal-scale observations of marine reserves suggest that indirect effects on taxa that occur through cascading trophic interactions take longer to develop than direct effects on target species. Combining and analyzing a unique set of long-term time series of ecologic data in and out of fisheries closures from disparate regions, we found that the time to initial detection of direct effects on target species (±SE) was 5.13 ± 1.9 years, whereas initial detection of indirect effects on other taxa, which were often trait mediated , took significantly longer (13.1 ± 2.0 years). Most target species showed initial direct effects, but their trajectories over time were highly variable. Many target species continued to increase, some leveled off, and others decreased. Decreases were due to natural fluctuations, fishing impacts from outside reserves, or indirect effects from target species at higher trophic levels. The average duration of stable periods for direct effects was 6.2 ± 1.2 years, even in studies of more than 15 years. For indirect effects, stable periods averaged 9.1 ± 1.6 years, although this was not significantly different from direct effects. Populations of directly targeted species were more stable in reserves than in fished areas, suggesting increased ecologic resilience. This is an important benefit of marine reserves with respect to their function as a tool for conservation and restoration. fishing effects | interactions | time lags | trophic cascade | marine protected area},

   abstract = {Changes in land use and water management practices in south Florida have altered the quality and quantity of freshwater flowing into Florida Bay. By the 1980s, reduced inflow and drought led to an extensive hypersaline phase in the bay. This phase had a drastic effect on benthic communities within the bay and possibly also on coral communities within the bay and the Florida Keys National Marine Sanctuary. Physical oceanographic measurements demonstrate the presence of warm, hypersaline, and turbid water on coral reefs offshore from the Florida Keys, especially near passes which conduct water from Florida Bay to the Atlantic Ocean. To examine the effect of Florida Bay water intrusions on coral reefs, we tested for significant effects of two stressors, elevated temperature and salinity, on coral production, respiration, and survival. Elevated temperatures produce significant reductions in photosynthesis, respiration, and net P : R ratios after 6 h of exposure, and elevated salinities produce similar results after 30 h. Exposure to both elevated temperature and salinity produces a highly significant (P 0.01), but short-term, mitigative interactive effect. The combination of the two stressors was less stressful (for the response variables measured) than the sum of the stressors acting independently. After 36 h of exposure, however, the mitigating effect disappeared and corals exposed to the combined stresses did not survive. A three-dimensional response surface, which predicts P : R ratios as a function of varying salinity and temperature, is used to construct a testable hypothesis to explain recent declines in coral cover on some reefs within Florida Bay and the Florida Keys. We chose salinity and temperature to test a multiple stressor model because they are relatively easy to manipulate. However, any enviromentally realistic model must include other potential stressors, such as turbidity, elevated nutrients, and environmental contaminants.},

   abstract = {Populations with dispersive larvae are often demographically open such that local reproduction and subsequent larval settlement are not linked. Thus, understanding whether and how settlement patterns are established and subsequently modified is central to understanding local demography. Settlement is typically not measured directly, but rather it is estimated by recruitment , which is the observation of new individuals sometime after settlement. At Lizard Island on the Great Barrier Reef, I examined how patterns of recruitment of coral reef fishes were modified across a range of natural recruit densities in the presence and absence of resident predators. Resident predators decreased recruitment and increased mortality for all species, but these effects varied considerably among species. The effects of predators on recruitment were at least partly due to mortality within 2 days after settlement. At their most extreme, predators caused recruitment failure of several species of but-terflyfish. For one species of damselfish (Pomacentrus amboinensis), predators both induced weakly density-dependent mortality and obscured any relationship between recruitment and subsequent abundance, while for another damselfish (Neopomacentrus cyanomos), mortality was density-independent and subsequent abundance was a function of recruitment. These contrasting results may reflect differences in prey behavior. P. ambo-inensis tended to feed near or within the branches of coral inhabited by resident predators, while N. cyanomos tended to feed higher in the water column above the reefs, and thus farther away from resident predators. These results highlight the speed and extent to which patterns of settlement are modified, indicating that caution should be exercised when attributing patterns of recruitment to patterns of settlement. Tremendous between species variation in how patterns of recruitment, and presumably settlement, were modified by predation indicates that generalizations or between-species ex-trapolations about the magnitude of these effects may be unwarranted.},

   abstract = {Little is known of the sources of mortality that affect local population dynam~cs of coral-reef fishes. To examine the role of predat~on, resident p~scivorous fishes [moray eels (Muraenidae), large squirrelfishes (Holocentridae), groupers (Serranidae), and snappers (Lutjanidae)] were removed from 3 of 6 isolated patch reefs of living coral near Lee Stocking Island, Bahamas, in 1992. All 6 reefs were then seeded with natural densities of newly settled recruits of 3 species: Chromis cyanea (blue chromis, Pomacentridae), Halichoerespictus (rainbow wrasse, Labridae), and Thalassoma bifasciatum (bluehead wrasse, Labridae). Controls showed that any secondary effects of transplanting new recruits were negligible. Over the next month, survivorship of C. cyanea (mean 41.3%) and H. pictus (80.8%) on the predator-absent reefs was significantly greater than on the predator-present (control) reefs (9.4% for C. cyanea and 43.2% for H. pictus). No statistical difference was evident for T bitasciatum (48.5 vs 37.8% survival), perhaps because juveniles of this species are cleaner fish and/or because they were less conspicuous to predators than the other species. Although the size distributions of the wrasses did not differ between treatments, the size distribution of C. cyanea shifted significantly. At the end of the experiment, surviv.ing C. cyanea were slightly larger on the predator-present reefs (mode = 4.0 cm total length, TL) than on the predator-absent reefs (mode = 3.5 cm TL), despite no significant difference at the start of the experiment (mode for both treatments = 3.0 cm TL). We interpret this size shift as predators differentially consuming smaller recruits and/or surviving recruits growing faster after densities were reduced by predators. Preliminary remote video monitoring of the activity of transient p~scivores [mostly jacks (Carangidae)] over the experimental reefs suggested that such predators may regularly visit isolated reefs in search of prey. If so, transient predators may have accounted for the surprisingly low first-month survivorship (about 40 to 80%) of new recruits on reefs where resident predators were removed. In any case, we conclude that resident predators can substantially alter the local density and size structure of reef fishes shortly after they settle from the plankton. Because pisci-vores differentially affected the survivorship of different species, predation may also influence the structure of reef-fish communities by altering the relative abundances of prey species established at the time of settlement.},

Greater habitat complexity is often associated with a greater abundance and diversity of organisms. High complexity habitats may reduce predation and competition, thereby allowing more individuals to occupy a given area. Using 16 spatially isolated reefs in the Bahamas, I tested whether increased habitat complexity reduced the negative effects of resident predators and competitors on recruitment and survival of a common damselfish. Two levels of habitat complexity were cross-factored with the presence or absence of two guilds of resident fishes: predators (sea basses and moray eels) and interference competitors (large territorial damselfishes). I monitored subsequent recruitment and recruit mortality for 60 days. Residents had strong negative effects on recruitment regardless of habitat complexity. In the presence of residents, recruits suffered high mortality immediately after settlement that was similar on low and high complexity reefs, although high complexity reduced mortality of recruits that survived this early postsettlement period. Comparisons between shelter hole diameters and the sizes of residents suggest that territorial damselfishes and small resident predators could access most shelter holes, whereas large resident predators were excluded from many shelter holes. This study demonstrates that whether habitat complexity reduces predation and competition may depend on several key factors, such as the availability of appropriate shelter, behavioral attributes of interactors, and developmental stage of prey/inferior competitors.},

   abstract = {1. No-take reserves are a common tool for fisheries management and biodiversity conservation in marine ecosystems. Despite much discussion of their benefits, data documenting many reserve effects are surprisingly scarce. Several studies have also been criticized for a lack of rigour so that changes within reserves cannot be separated from underlying natural variation and attributed unequivocally to protection. 2. We sampled both benthic (video quadrats) and associated fish communities (underwater visual censuses) in a well-enforced reserve in The Bahamas. Sampling was explicitly stratified by habitat (' Montastraea reef' and 'gorgonian plain'). To distinguish reserve effects from natural variation, we compared changes inside and outside the reserve with those seen at equivalent spatial scales in other reef systems in the Bahamian archipelago that lack reserves. Reserve-level differences in benthic or fish communities not documented in other reef systems are categorized as 'robust' effects. 3. Robust reserve effects were limited to Montastraea reefs. The reserve supported an average of ≈ 15% more fish species per site compared to outside the reserve. This pattern was particularly driven by more large-bodied grouper, damselfish, and butterflyfish species inside the reserve. Increases in fish biomass and differences in community structure inside the reserve were limited to large-bodied groupers. Increased grazing pressure by parrotfishes in the reserve has lowered macroalgal cover, and caused previously undocumented changes in benthic community structure compared to sites outside the reserve. 4. Some reserve-level differences in fish communities were categorized as 'misleading' because equivalent differences were seen in other reef systems, and are likely to be caused by natural intra-habitat variation. Separation of robust and misleading results was only possible because of archipelago-scale sampling. 5. Synthesis and applications. The Bahamas represents a relatively lightly fished system within the Caribbean. However, cessation of fishing has still increased the mean number of species, the abundance of the most highly prized fishes and, through trophic cascades, altered benthic community structure. In certain habitats, reserves are clearly important for conserving fisheries and biodiversity. However, reserve effects must be explicitly separated from confounding variables to ensure conservation benefits are accurately identified and reported, and not oversold to managers and local stakeholders.},

Bluespine unicornfish were site-attached to home ranges situated within the reserve boundaries and their movements were aligned with topographic features. Two different diel movement patterns ('commuting' and 'foraying') were observed. Commuters made crepus-cular migrations of several hundred meters between daytime foraging areas and nighttime refuge holes. Foraying fish did not partake in crepuscular migrations and utilized refuge holes both day and night. Two bluespine unicornfish were also nocturnally active. There was little direct evidence of dispersal from the reserve but differences in bluespine unicornfish abundance and size among reef habitat zones were consistent with ontogenetic habitat shifts. The influence of habitat topography on bluespine unicornfish movements suggests that gross habitat characteristics could be used to predict reef fish movements. This could provide a simple method for setting marine reserve boundaries at sites for which empirical fish movement data are unavailable.},

   abstract = {No-take marine reserves are advocated widely as a potential solution to the loss of marine biodiversity and ecosystem structure, and to over-fishing. We assess the duration of protection required for unfished populations of large predatory reef fish to attain natural states. We have monitored two marine reserves at Sumilon and Apo Islands, Philippines, regularly for 17 years (1983-2000). The biomass of large predatory fish was still increasing exponentially after 9 and 18 years of protection at Sumilon and Apo reserves, respectively. There was little evidence that the rate of accumulation of biomass inside the reserves was slowing down even after so many years of protection. This suggests that the length of time to full recovery will be considerable. We made two assumptions in order to estimate this period. Firstly, that biomass growth will follow the logistic model. Secondly, the conservative assumption that biomass had already attained 90% of the local carrying capacity of the environments in the reserves. We conclude that the time required for full recovery will be 15 and 40 years at Sumilon and Apo reserves, respectively. Such durations of recovery appear consistent with known life history characteristics of these fish, and with empirical data on recovery rates of heavily exploited fish stocks. By the time the full fisheries or ecosystem benefits from such reserves are apparent, human populations and impacts will have doubled in much of the developing world. Thus, networks of such reserves need to be implemented immediately. Furthermore, the management mechanisms for the reserves need to be successful over timescales of human generations.},

   abstract = {1. Abundance trends provide key guidance when setting conservation priorities, whether indicating population decline, stability or recovery. Knowledge of the power of surveys to detect trends is essential, as the consequences of not detecting a real trend can be profound. 2. Unfortunately, some surveys have been established with no assessment of power, and others are used to study species that were not their original focus. The latter is common in the marine environment, where rare fish are monitored using catch data from surveys that target more abundant commercially fished species. 3. We calculated the power of a large-scale annual monitoring survey (the English North Sea bottom trawl survey) to detect decline and recovery of species that are vulnerable to fishing. As fisheries exploitation invariably precedes scientific investigation , the survey began after many vulnerable species had already been depleted. 4. The power of the survey to detect declines in the abundance of vulnerable species on time scales of < 10 years was low and the survey often failed to detect declines that would lead to listings under the IUCN A1 Red List criteria. Thus conservation prioritization based solely on survey data may fail to identify species at risk of regional extinction. 5. If conservation measures were effective, and vulnerable populations recovered at the maximum potential rate, 5-10 years of monitoring would often be required to detect recovery. 6. Power to detect trends in abundance was increased by developing a composite indicator that reflected trends in abundance of several vulnerable species. This indicator provided an overview of their conservation status. 7. Synthesis and applications. Consistent with the precautionary principle, conservation prioritization and management action should not depend on the statistical significance of recent abundance trends when low power is a consequence of historical depletion. If the conservation prioritization and management of rare and/or vulnerable species have to be predicated on evidence of significant declines, then higher type 1 error rates (falsely detecting a decline) should be acceptable. This is because the costs of type 1 errors are lower than those of type 2 (failure to detect a real decline).},

We collected fin rays using a non-lethal technique that is minimally invasive with no known negative effects on growth or survival. Trace metal constituents in the fin rays were quantified with an inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometer via laser ablation (LA-ICP-MS). Two spatial scales were quantified to test the limitations of grouping individuals based on elemental compositions. On a small spatial scale (i.e., 100s of m), individuals were correctly classified within individual watersheds 64% of the time. On a larger spatial scale (i.e., 10s-100s of km), juveniles were classified with 100% accuracy. Trace metals in adults were analyzed by back-tracking across fin ray annuli to a year in which our previous studies have shown these adults occupied their juvenile habitats (i.e., 2006). These fish were grouped using a measure of dissimilarity and then analyzed to test whether we could reclassify them into these same groupings based solely on the chemical components in their fin rays, which was done with over 84% accuracy. Although juvenile habitats of the adults could not be determined due to the lack of base-line data, classifications were driven by similar elements to those that drove the classification of juveniles, suggesting similar physiological mechanisms. The results highlight the importance of spatial scale for interpreting microchemical analyses on calcified structures in fishes.},

@report{Biro2008,
   abstract = {The possibility for fishery-induced evolution of life history traits is an important but unresolved issue for exploited fish populations. Because fisheries tend to select and remove the largest individuals, there is the evolutionary potential for lasting effects on fish production and productivity. Size selection represents an indirect mechanism of selection against rapid growth rate, because individual fish may be large because of rapid growth or because of slow growth but old age. The possibility for direct selection on growth rate, whereby fast-growing genotypes are more vulnerable to fishing irrespective of their size, is unexplored. In this scenario, faster-growing genotypes may be more vulnerable to fishing because of greater appetite and correspondingly greater feeding-related activity rates and boldness that could increase encounter with fishing gear and vulnerability to it. In a realistic whole-lake experiment, we show that fast-growing fish genotypes are harvested at three times the rate of the slow-growing genotypes within two replicate lake populations. Overall, 50% of fast-growing individuals were harvested compared with 30% of slow-growing individuals, independent of body size. Greater harvest of fast-growing genotypes was attributable to their greater behavioral vulnerability, being more active and bold. Given that growth is heritable in fishes, we speculate that evolution of slower growth rates attributable to behavioral vulnerability may be widespread in harvested fish populations. Our results indicate that commonly used minimum size-limits will not prevent overexploi-tation of fast-growing genotypes and individuals because of size-independent growth-rate selection by fishing. behavior fisheries selection temperament I t is well known that fisheries tend to select for larger and older fish individuals because of preference and/or regulations imposing minimum size limits for harvest. The result of sustained and heavy size-selective harvesting over time has been the removal of larger and/or later-maturing individuals from populations , leaving behind populations consisting of small, early-maturing individuals, with low fecundity (1-3). Because growth rate affects fish size at age and size at maturity, a size-selective fishery may indirectly remove faster-growing individuals from a population. Studies suggest that this effect may represent contemporary evolution, leaving behind genotypes that are slower-growing and early-maturing; this then can lead to reductions in harvestable biomass and population fecundity that in turn hinders population recovery from harvest (2-5). The possibility for evolutionary responses should not be surprising given high heritability of growth rate and other life history parameters in fish and the intensity of size-selective fish harvest reviewed in refs. 2, 6, and 7. However, we are aware of only two studies providing strong evidence of fisheries-induced evolution of growth and/or other life history traits (4, 5). A fishery may select upon growth rate through both indirect and direct mechanisms. Indirect selection occurs through removal of larger individuals from a population, whereby faster-growing individuals attain harvestable size at a younger age, thus increasing time spent vulnerable to the fishery. However, size selection alone may not be a strong selective pressure on growth rate if fish are large predominantly because they are old but slow-growing. By contrast, direct selection would occur if faster-growing individuals are more vulnerable to fishing gear because of their behavior, independent of their body size. Direct selection on growth rate is likely because faster growth usually is achieved by individuals and genotypes that expend more effort to secure food resources, even at the expense of risk of predation (8-11). Fast-growing individuals/genotypes typically are more active, more bold in the face of risk, and more aggressive than slow-growing individuals/genotypes (5, 8-10, 12). Given these positive correlations between activity and boldness traits and growth rate, we expect that fast-growing individuals will encounter fishing gear more frequently because of greater activity rates, be less likely to detect and avoid them because of decreased vigilance (i.e., greater boldness), and aggressively pursue lures and baits. Therefore, the probability of harvest of individual fish should be proportional to their behavioral vulnerability, even for fish of equal size. Although size selection is known to result in evolution of lower growth rate and age at maturity in the laboratory (5) and in wild populations (4), the possibility that a fishery may directly select on growth rate because of behavior has not been tested. If so, behavioral vulnerability would represent a unique mechanism for selection on growth rate not previously considered in the context of fisheries harvest management. If this unique mechanism of selection exists, it may suggest that evolutionary changes in harvested fish populations are more likely and occur more rapidly than previously thought when based solely on predictions from indirect size-selection effects. Here, we present data from whole-lake experiments showing that genotypes of rainbow trout with high intrinsic growth rate and bold behavioral traits (fast/bold) are more vulnerable to a simulated commercial fishery than slow-growing and shy genotypes (slow/shy), even when the fishing gear does not target specific sizes of fish and size variation in the catch is controlled for statistically. That is, exploitation removes faster-growing individuals from a population by direct selection on behavioral genotype, independent of body size. For the experiments, we use two genotypes of trout known to differ in intrinsic growth rate when fed ad libitum, activity rates, and degree of boldness (see Methods for details). Briefly, we stocked equal densities of each genotype into two small experimental lakes, simulated an inten},

   abstract = {As a result of being hunted, animals often alter their behaviour in ways that make future encounters with predators less likely. When hunting is carried out for conservation, for example to control invasive species, these behavioural changes can inadvertently impede the success of future efforts. We examined the effects of repeated culling by spearing on the behaviour of invasive predatory lionfish (Pterois volitans/miles) on Bahamian coral reef patches. We compared the extent of concealment and activity levels of lionfish at dawn and midday on 16 coral reef patches off Eleuthera, The Bahamas. Eight of the patches had been subjected to regular daytime removals of lionfish by spearing for two years. We also estimated the distance at which lionfish became alert to slowly approaching divers on culled and unculled reef patches. Lionfish on culled reefs were less active and hid deeper within the reef during the day than lionfish on patches where no culling had occurred. There were no differences at dawn when removals do not take place. Lionfish on culled reefs also adopted an alert posture at a greater distance from divers than lionfish on unculled reefs. More crepuscular activity likely leads to greater encounter rates by lionfish with more native fish species because the abundance of reef fish outside of shelters typically peaks at dawn and dusk. Hiding deeper within the reef could also make remaining lionfish less likely to be encountered and more difficult to catch by spearfishers during culling efforts. Shifts in the behaviour of hunted invasive animals might be common and they have implications both for the impact of invasive species and for the design and success of invasive control programs.},

Here, we review recent studies in threespined sticklebacks (a species in which males are the sole providers of parental care) showing that when parents are exposed to an ecologically relevant stressor (predation risk), there are consequences for offspring. For example, female sticklebacks exposed to predation risk produce eggs with higher concentrations of cortisol, a stress hormone, and offspring with altered behavior and physiology. Male sticklebacks exposed to predation risk produce offspring that are less active, smaller, and in poorer condition. The precise mechanisms by which maternal and paternal experiences with predators affect offspring phenotypes are under investigation, and could include steroid hormones, olfactory cues and/or parental behavior. As in other species, some of the consequences of parental exposure to predation risk for offspring in sticklebacks might be adaptive, but depend on the stressor, the reliability of the parental and offspring environments and the evolutionary history of the population.

Although theory is rapidly developing in this area, there are few empirical tests. There are at least two hypotheses to explain why individuals behave differently from one another in a dynamic social environment. The social niche specialization hypothesis proposes that repeated social interactions generate consistent individual differences in social behaviour. The behav-ioural type hypothesis proposes that an individual's social behaviour reflects its behavioural type. We tested these two hypotheses by manipulating the opportunity for repeated social interactions in groups of threespine stickleback, Gasterosteus aculeatus, and by measuring the behavioural types of the same individuals in three contexts: when in a novel environment, when presented with an opportunity to associate with conspecifics and when confronted by an intruder. We found no evidence that repeated social interactions increased between-individual variation in social foraging behaviour. Instead, in-dividuals' social foraging behaviour was related to their behavioural type, specifically their shoaling behaviour. In addition, the behavioural types of the members of a group strongly influenced a group's average foraging behaviour. Together, these results do not support the hypothesis that social dynamics within groups generates individual differences in behaviour. Instead, they suggest the reverse: individual differences in behaviour drive group-level dynamics. Ó},

   abstract = {How predators and prey interact has important consequences for population dynamics and community stability. Here we explored how predator-prey interactions are simultaneously affected by reciprocal behavioral plasticity (i.e., plasticity in prey defenses countered by plasticity in predator offenses and vice versa) and consistent individual behavioral variation (i.e., behavioral types) within both predator and prey populations. We assessed the behavior of a predator species (northern pike) and a prey species (three-spined stickleback) during one-on-one encounters. We also measured additional behavioral and morphological traits in each species. Using structural equation modeling, we found that reciprocal behavioral plasticity as well as predator and prey behavioral types influenced how individuals behaved during an interaction. Thus, the progression and ultimate outcome of predator-prey interactions depend on both the dynamic behavioral feedback occurring during the encounter and the underlying behavioral type of each participant. We also examined whether predator behavioral type is underlain by differences in metabolism and organ size. We provide some of the first evidence that behavioral type is related to resting metabolic rate and size of a sensory organ (the eyes). Understanding the extent to which reciprocal behavioral plasticity and intraspecific behavioral variation influence the outcome of species interactions could provide insight into the maintenance of behavioral variation as well as community dynamics.},

This challenge is especially apparent when sampling units are spread across a heterogeneous landscape or along an environmental gradient because multiple mechanisms can produce similar co-occurrence patterns. We developed a trait-based approach for discriminating between environmental filtering and biotic interactions as the probable driver of co-occurrence patterns across environmentally heterogeneous sites. We demonstrate our framework by analyzing the co-occurrence of small mammals over elevation in three independent mountain ranges in the Great Basin of the western United States. Our sampling design accounts for landscape scale environmental variability and within-site habitat heterogeneity. We identified 52 non-random species pairs, of which 36 were aggregated and 16 were segregated. For each pair, we determined which mechanism was the likely ecological explanation using a hypothesis-testing framework based on functional trait similarity. Expectations of biotic interactions were based on similarity of diet and body size whereas habitat affinity and geographic range were used for environmental filtering. Only four pairs were consistent with expectations under biotic interactions, including pairs for which competitive exclusion has previously been documented. In addition to analyzing individual pairs, we used binomial tests of observed versus expected totals of intra-and inter-guild pairs to determine assemblage-wide deviations from random community structure. Signatures of environmental filtering were consistent across mountain ranges and scales. Despite differences in species composition and significant pairs among data sets, our approach revealed consistent mech-anistic conclusions, emphasizing the value of trait-based methods to co-occurrence and community assembly.},

   abstract = {Habitat structure plays an important mediating role in predator-prey interactions. However the effects are strongly dependent on regional predator pools, which can drive predation risk in habitats with very similar structure in opposite directions. In the Mediterranean Sea predation on juvenile sea urchins is commonly known to be regulated by seagrass structure. In this study we test whether the possibility for juvenile Paracentrotus lividus to be pre-dated changes in relation to the fragmentation of the seagrass Posidonia oceanica (four habitat classes: continuous, low-fragmentation, high-fragmentation and rocks), and to the spatial arrangement of such habitat classes at a landscape scale. Sea urchin predation risk was measured in a 20-day field experiment on tethered individuals placed in three square areas 35×35 m 2 in size. Variability of both landscape and habitat structural attributes was assessed at the sampling grain 5×5 m 2. Predation risk changed among landscapes, as it was lower where more 'rocks', and thus less seagrass, were present. The higher risk was found in the 'continuous' P. oceanica rather than in the low-fragmentation, high-fragmentation and rock habitats (p-values = 0.0149, 0.00008, and 0.0001, respectively). Therefore, the expectation that juvenile P. lividus survival would have been higher in the 'continuous' seagrass habitat, which would have served as shelter from high fish predation pressure, was not met. Predation risk changed across habitats due to different success between attack types: benthic attacks (mostly from whelks) were overall much more effective than those due to fish activity, the former type being associated with the 'continuous' seagrass habitat. Fish predation on juvenile sea urchins on rocks and 'high-fragmentation' habitat was less likely than benthic predation in the 'continuous' seagrass, with the low seagrass patch complexity increasing benthic activity. Future research should be aimed at investigating , derived from the complex indirect interactions among species, how top-down control in marine reserves can modify seagrass habitat effects.},

   abstract = {Recent studies document unprecedented declines in marine top predators that can initiate trophic cascades. Predicting the wider ecological consequences of these declines requires understanding how predators influence communities by inflicting mortality on prey and inducing behavioral modifications (risk effects). Both mechanisms are important in marine communities, and a sole focus on the effects of predator-inflicted mortality might severely underestimate the importance of predators. We outline direct and indirect consequences of marine predator declines and propose an integrated predictive framework that includes risk effects, which appear to be strongest for long-lived prey species and when resources are abundant. We conclude that marine predators should be managed for the maintenance of both density-and risk-driven ecological processes , and not demographic persistence alone. Declines in marine top predators Predators that occupy high trophic levels in marine habitats, including marine mammals, large teleosts and sharks, have been declining worldwide at a rapid pace [1-4]. Recent estimates suggest that populations of large sharks have declined regionally by 90% or more [3,5]. The status of large tuna, billfish and groundfish [2] and reef-associated predators in human-impacted areas [6] is equally dire. Although the magnitude of some declines is debated, few researchers doubt the generality of sweeping changes to the abundance of upper trophic levels in the oceans. Clearly, accurate prediction of the ecological consequences of these and potential future declines is critical for fisheries and ocean ecosystem management. Ecosystem models currently are the most common method for exploring the wider effects of declining upper trophic levels. These models, however, are driven by detailed system-specific data that might limit the generality of predictions and also preclude parameterization in data-poor situations (Box 1). Given these concerns, is it possible to make generalized predictions about the likely responses of marine communities to the loss of top predators? Addressing this question requires a functional understanding of how top predators affect the dynamics of marine communities. Recent studies from diverse systems show that predators influence prey populations and communities by inflicting mortality on prey (direct predation) and inducing costly antipredator behavior by their prey (risk effects [7]). Studies in marine systems involving upper trophic level predators, however, have largely failed to consider risk effects. Here we review studies of community rearrangements following marine top predator declines and of how marine predators influence their communities through direct predation and risk effects. Through this synthesis, we build the case that a framework integrating both direct predation and risk effects can achieve improved predictions on the ecological consequences of marine predator declines. Marine communities change when top predators decline Predicting the ecological consequences of reductions in top predators is, in essence, an inquiry into the importance of top-down processes. From groundbreaking work on rocky intertidal shores [8] to the documentation of the keystone role of sea otters in kelp forests [9] and studies of the indirect effects of bird predation [10], among many other examples, there is little doubt that predators have a fundamental influence on the structure and function of marine communities. Hence, widespread declines of large Review Glossary Behaviorally mediated indirect interaction: occurs when changes in the abundance of one species results in a change in the behavior of a second species (a risk effect) that in turn influences a third species. Density-mediated indirect interaction: occurs when changes in the abundance of one species affect the density of another species through direct predation, which in turn changes densities of a third species. Direct predation effect: effects of predator-inflicted mortality on prey populations. Keystone species: a species that has an impact on community structure disproportionate to its abundance. Megagrazers: large-bodied marine grazers (e.g. green turtles, dugongs and manatees). Mesoconsumer: predators or herbivores in mid-trophic levels. These species are at risk of predation from top predators, and therefore transmit effects of top predators to lower trophic levels. Predatory release: when reductions in the density of top predators causes a numerical increase of their prey. Resource species: in the context of this review, a species that is eaten by mesoconsumers. Depending on the mesoconsumer, resource species are consumers at lower trophic levels (e.g. small teleosts) or primary producers (e.g. seagrasses). Risk effect: changes in prey species (e.g. distribution, energy state, reproductive output) resulting from behavioral responses to the risk of predation. State-dependent behavior: behavioral responses to extrinsic factors (e.g. background level of predation risk) that are assumed to maximize fitness in the context of the physiological (e.g. fat stores), environmental (e.g. resource availability) or other states of the organisms that influence residual reproductive value. Trophic cascade: changes in the relative abundances of multiple species in an ecological community as a result of changes in abundance of one species. Trophic cascades ensue from both direct predation and risk effects of predators.},

   abstract = {Paradigms of sustainable exploitation focus on population dynamics of prey and yields to humanity but ignore the behavior of humans as predators. We compared patterns of predation by contemporary hunters and fishers with those of other predators that compete over shared prey (terrestrial mammals and marine fishes). Our global survey (2125 estimates of annual finite exploitation rate) revealed that humans kill adult prey, the reproductive capital of populations, at much higher median rates than other predators (up to 14 times higher), with particularly intense exploitation of terrestrial carnivores and fishes. Given this competitive dominance, impacts on predators, and other unique predatory behavior, we suggest that humans function as an unsustainable "super predator," which-unless additionally constrained by managers-will continue to alter ecological and evolutionary processes globally. H umans have diverged from other predators in behavior and influence. Geographic expansion, exploitation of naïve prey, killing technology, symbioses with dogs, and rapid population growth, among other factors, have long imposed profound impacts-including widespread extinction and restructuring of food webs and ecosystems-in terrestrial and marine systems (1-3). Despite contributions from the "sustainable exploitation" paradigm (4), contemporary humans can rapidly drive prey declines (5-7), degrade ecosystems (8, 9), and impose evolutionary change in prey (10, 11). Owing to long-term coevolutionary relationships that generally limit exploitation rates, especially on adult prey, these are extreme outcomes that nonhuman predators seldom impose. Meanwhile, whether present and future exploitation can be considered sustainable is hotly contested, especially in fisheries. Debate has been largely restricted to elements of the sustainable exploitation model, namely, a model of prey abundance and yields to humanity (e.g., 12, 13). Here, we approach the notion of sustainable exploitation differently by asking whether humans-extreme in their impacts-are extreme in their predatory behavior (14, 15). Previous work has variously estimated exploitation by humans, non-human predators, or both, but systematic comparisons have focused on specific taxa or regions, have lumped all predators together, have been reconstructed indirectly, and/or did not include age classes (e.g., 14, 16, 17). We address these limitations with data spanning wildlife, tropical wild meat, and fisheries systems (data files S1 and S2). We examine variation in annual finite exploitation rates of marine fishes from every ocean (n = 1494 estimates, 282 species from 110 communities) and terrestrial mammals from every continent except Antarctica (631 estimates , 117 species from 179 communities) (fig. S1 and tables S1 and S2) by predator type (hu-mans versus nonhuman), ecosystem (marine versus terrestrial), region, and trophic level. We focus on adult prey because hunters and fishers overwhelmingly target adults (18). We complement this quantitative assessment by identifying additionally unique predatory behaviors by humans that (i) facilitate the large differences in exploitation rates we detect and (ii) elicit the manifold consequences of humanity's predatory hegemony. Differences in exploitation rates between hunters and terrestrial predators varied among comparisons. Globally and pooled across trophic levels, exploitation rates by hunters (median = 0.06) did not differ from those of carnivores [median = 0.05; Wilcoxon test W = 46076, P adj(2) = 0.11] (Fig. 1A and figs. S2A and S3A). A paired comparison over shared prey within the same community, however, revealed that hunters exploit at higher rates than the highest-exploiting terrestrial predator [paired Wilcoxon test V = 929, P adj(2) = 0.03] (fig. S3B). Additionally, a similar paired comparison showed that the median proportion of mortality (an independent metric) caused by hunters (0.35) was 1.9 times that (0.19) caused by all other predators combined (paired Wilcoxon test V = 1605, P = 0.004) (Fig. 1B). Trophic level and regional analyses (across taxa and areas with abundant data) revealed additional patterns. Although globally pooled comparisons showed that hunters and terrestrial predators exploited herbivores (artiodactyls) at similar rates [W = 14751, P adj(9) = 1.00] (Fig. 1C), hunters in North America and Europe exploited herbivores at median rates 7.2 and 12.5 times those of hunters in Africa [both P adj(9) < 0.04]; rates did not differ statistically between hunters and terrestrial predators within any of the regions (fig. S4A). Globally, hunters exploited meso-carnivores [W = 248, P adj(9) = 0.03] and large carnivores [W = 181, P adj(9) < 0.001] at higher rates than nonhuman predators by factors of 4.3 and 9.2, respectively (Fig. 1C). Remarkably, hunters exploited large carnivores at 3.7 times the rate that they killed herbivores [W = 2697, P adj(9) < 0.001] (Fig. 1C). Fisheries exploited adult prey at higher rates than any other of the planet's predators (Fig. 1A and fig. S2B). Among nonhuman predators across all oceans, 50% of exploitation rates were less than 1% of annual adult biomass. In contrast, fisheries exploited more than 10% of adult biomass in 62% of cases. Overall, the median fishing rate (0.14) was 14.1 times the take (0.01) by marine predators [W = 83614, P adj(2) < 0.001] (fig. S3A). In paired comparisons, median fisheries exploitation (0.17) was 3.1 times the median rate (0.06) by the highest exploiting marine predator of the same prey [V = 382, P adj(2) = 0.02] (fig. S3B). At all trophic levels, humans killed fishes at higher rates than marine predators [all P adj(9) < 0.04] (Fig. 1D), but there were no differences in take by each predator across trophic levels [all P adj(9) ≥ 0.5]. Pooling all trophic levels, the median rate of Atlantic fisheries exploitation (0.20) was 2.9 times that of Pacific fisheries [median = 0.07, W = 6633, P adj(4) < 0.001] (fig. S4B). Although our varied data set could impose biases in both directions (supplementary text), we reveal striking differences in exploitation rates between nonhuman predators and contemporary humans, particularly fishers and carni-vore hunters. Interactions between human and natural systems likely underlie patterns. For example , global seafood markets, industrial processing , relatively high fecundity among fishes, and schooling behavior could, in part, explain the particularly high fisheries take, whereas gape limitation by piscivores and a generally species-rich marine environment might explain why marine predator rates are comparatively low. Higher human densities and reduced fish bio-mass (from longer exploitation) likely explain higher fishing rates in the Atlantic versus Pacific oceans. Moreover, motivations to kill typically inedible carnivores for trophy and competitive reasons [intraguild predation; (7)] are evidently powerful and drive acutely high rates. Although, in terms of numbers, it is easy to exploit high proportions of (less abundant) carnivore populations , the implications remain profound (below). In addition, whereas declines in tropical wild meat (5) might predict an opposite pattern, lower hunting rates of African herbi-vores could relate to simpler technology, less reporting, and/or longer adaptation to human predation. Whereas sociopolitical factors can explain why humans repeatedly overexploit (19), cultural and technological dimensions can explain how. Human predatory behavior evolved much faster than competing predators and the defensive adaptations of prey (20).

Here, we synthesize existing literature and data to explore multiple lines of evidence that collectively suggest diverse human activities are changing marine ecosystems, including carbon storage capacity, in myriad ways by altering predation risk. We provide novel, compelling evidence that at least one key human activity, overfishing, can lead to distinct, cascading risk effects in natural ecosystems whose magnitude exceeds that of presumed lethal effects and may account for previously unexplained findings. We further discuss the conservation implications of human-caused indirect risk effects. Finally, we provide a predictive framework for when human alterations of risk in oceans should lead to cascading effects and outline a prospectus for future research. Given the speed and extent with which human activities are altering marine risk landscapes, it is crucial that conservation and management policy considers the indirect effects of these activities in order to increase the likelihood of success and avoid unfortunate surprises.},

Behavioural traits of trout were scored before and after a 2-month interval covering a major survival bottleneck, whereupon the consistency and covariance of behaviours were analysed. We found that selection favoured individuals with high activity levels in an open-field context, a personality trait consistent throughout the duration of the experiment. In addition, a behavioural syndrome emerged over the 2 months in the wild, linking activity to aggressiveness and exploration tendency. These novel results suggest that behavioural syndromes can emerge rapidly in nature from interaction between natural selection and behavioural plasticity affecting single behaviours.},

   abstract = {When individual animals make decisions, they routinely use information produced intentionally or unintentionally by other individuals. Despite its prevalence and established fitness consequences, the effects of such social information on ecological dynamics remain poorly understood. Here, we synthesize results from ecology, evolutionary biology, and animal behavior to show how the use of social information can profoundly influence the dynamics of populations and communities. We combine recent theoretical and empirical results and introduce simple population models to illustrate how social information use can drive positive density-dependent growth of populations and communities (Allee effects). Furthermore, social information can shift the nature and strength of species interactions, change the outcome of competition, and potentially increase extinction risk in harvested populations and communities. What Is Social Information and How Could It Be Important to Ecology? As they go about their daily lives, organisms continuously produce information, both actively through signals (e.g., alarm calls [1,2]; see Glossary) and passively through cues (e.g., the act of fleeing can warn others of danger, and metabolic excretions can inadvertently provide information on the presence and physiological state of an organism [2,3]). This plethora of visual, acoustic, tactile, olfactory, and gustatory information means that organisms live in environments rich with insights into the identity, state, and actions of individuals in their neighborhood. A given piece of social information remains relevant to receivers for a limited amount of time (e.g., information on an attacking predator may be useful only for an instant) [4]. However, because social information is continuously produced, making use of it can improve the ability of an individual to make decisions over the long term, for example, by extending, beyond its own sensory abilities, the range or resolution at which it is able to perceive and respond to environmental gradients [5] or threats [1]. Behavioral ecologists have long studied how social information shared among conspecifics can influence habitat selection and trophic interactions [6-8]. Animals often use social information to acquire resources (e.g., individuals or groups feeding in a location alert others to food) [2,9-14] and to detect and avoid predators [1,2,6,15-17]. Social transmission of information about resources or danger occurs within species, as in the iconic examples of single-species flocks of birds or schools of fish; however, social information is also often transmitted among nearby individuals of different and sometimes distantly related species [1,4,18] (Box 1). For over a decade, seminal review papers have highlighted the evolutionary and ecological mechanisms that underlie social information use, and how this widespread phenomenon can affect animal behavior [1-4,18]. From these works and subsequent publications discussed below, it is clear that social information, shared within or across species, can have profound effects on animal behaviors and, in turn, can directly affect individual fitness [9,19] (Figure 1). Despite this, population and community ecologists have Highlights Mounting evidence shows that social information drives animal behavior and fitness in various ecological contexts, including habitat selection, foraging, and predator avoidance. However, only recently have researchers begun to implicate social information in the dynamics of populations and communities. By driving correlations in the behavior and space use of many individuals that share resources or threats, social information can cause positive density dependence in behaviors that underlie individual fitness. Consequently, social information can drive positive density dependence (i.e., Allee effects) in population growth rates and resultant critical population thresholds, potentially affecting the extinction risk of populations and communities. Social information can also affect the nature , strength, and dynamics of species interactions, allowing even strong competitors to coexist through facilitation. Recent studies suggest that social information, often produced or used asymmetrically among individuals or species, generally affects how populations and communities respond to environmental change and, thus, is critical to consider in resource management and conservation.},

   abstract = {It is thought that recovery of marine habitats from uncontrollable disturbance may be faster in marine reserves than in unprotected habitats. But which marine habitats should be protected, those areas at greatest risk or those at least risk? We first defined this problem mathematically for 2 alternate conservation objectives. We then analytically solved this problem for both objectives and determined under which conditions each of the different protection strategies was optimal. If the conservation objective was to maximize the chance of having at least 1 healthy site, then the best strategy was protection of the site at lowest risk. On the other hand, if the goal was to maximize the expected number of healthy sites, the optimal strategy was more complex. If protected sites were likely to spend a significant amount of time in a degraded state, then it was best to protect low-risk sites. Alternatively, if most areas were generally healthy then, counterintuitively, it was best to protect sites at higher risk. We applied these strategies to a situation of cyclone disturbance of coral reefs on Australia's Great Barrier Reef. With regard to the risk of cyclone disturbance, the optimal reef to protect differed dramatically, depending on the expected speed of reef recovery of both protected and unprotected reefs. An adequate consideration of risk is fundamental to all conservation actions and can indicate surprising routes to conservation success. ¿Debemos Proteger al Fuerte o al Débil?

   abstract = {Design and decision-making for marine protected areas (MPAs) on coral reefs require prediction of MPA effects with population models. Modeling of MPAs has shown how the persistence of metapopulations in systems of MPAs depends on the size and spacing of MPAs, and levels of fishing outside the MPAs. However, the pattern of demographic connectivity produced by larval dispersal is a key uncertainty in those modeling studies. The information required to assess population persistence is a dispersal matrix containing the fraction of larvae traveling to each location from each location, not just the current number of larvae exchanged among locations. Recent metapopulation modeling research with hypothetical dispersal matrices has shown how the spatial scale of dispersal, degree of advection versus diffusion, total larval output, and temporal and spatial variability in dispersal influence population persistence. Recent empirical studies using population genetics, parentage analysis, and geo-chemical and artificial marks in calcified structures have improved the understanding of dispersal. However, many such studies report current self-recruitment (locally produced settlement/settlement from elsewhere), which is not as directly useful as local retention (locally produced set-tlement/total locally released), which is a component of the dispersal matrix. Modeling of biophysical circulation with larval particle tracking can provide the required elements of dispersal matrices and assess their sensitivity to flows and larval behavior, but it requires more assumptions than direct empirical methods. To make rapid progress in understanding the scales and patterns of connectivity, greater communication between empiricists and population modelers will be needed. Empiricists need to focus more on identifying the characteristics of the dispersal matrix, while population modelers need to track and assimilate evolving empirical results.},

Using a general theoretical framework, we investigate whether dynamic closures can improve the mean biomass of herbivorous fishes on reef systems, thereby enhancing resilience to undesirable phase-shifts. At current levels of reservation (10-30%), moving protection between all reefs in a system is unlikely to improve herbivore biomass, but can lead to a more even distribution of biomass. However, if protected areas are rotated among an appropriate subset of the entire reef system (e.g. rotating 10 protected areas between only 20 reefs in a 100 reef system), dynamic closures always lead to increased mean herbivore biomass. The management strategy that will achieve the highest mean herbivore biomass depends on both the trajectories and rates of population recovery and decline. Given the current large-scale threats to coral reefs, the ability of dynamic marine protected areas to achieve conservation goals deserves more attention.},

@report{Hannah2007,
   abstract = {G lobal climate is now rapidly changing, with consequent geographic rearrangement of species and recent climate-related extinctions (Root et al. 2003; Pounds et al. 2006). Yet protected areas (including national parks, nature reserves, and multiple-use conservation areas) are still the mainstay of modern conservation efforts (Rodrigues et al. 2004). Protected areas are geographically fixed and increasingly isolated by habitat destruction, and are therefore poorly suited to accommodating species range shifts due to climate change (Peters and Myers 1991). Here, we ask the question: are protected areas a relevant conservation response in an era of rapid climate change? Evaluating the effectiveness of protected areas is a problem in conservation planning that is made more complicated by climate change. A major goal of systematic conservation planning is to ensure that all species are represented within the protected areas of a given geographic region (Margules and Pressey 2000). Completing an existing protected area system in a given region so that it represents all known species generally proceeds by assessing the species already protected and then systematically adding complementary areas until all species are represented. Multiple representations of populations or species occurrences are usually necessary to ensure the conservation of each species, so for large numbers of species the process can be quite complex. For this reason, computer-automated selection routines, known as "reserve selection algorithms", have been developed (Pressey and Cowling 2001). The problem is more complex when species' ranges become dynamic as the result of climate change. One approach is to couple species distribution models and reserve selection algorithms (Araújo et al. 2004; Williams et al. 2005). Species distribution models use statistical or heuristic packages that simulate the present range of a species, based on relationships between known points of species' occurrence and climate at the time those points were recorded. A simulated present range is required because no species' distribution is perfectly known, while a simulation of future range is needed to account for the range shift likely to accompany changing climatic conditions. When such modeled ranges are available for large numbers of species (ideally hundreds or thousands), a reserve selection algorithm can be used to design a protected-areas system that represents all species, both in the present and in the future. This is most easily done by starting with existing protected areas and adding additional areas to complete species representation. One possible goal for such a process in a changing climate is maintenance of current species representation. However, some species' ranges cover large portions of current protected areas, while others are represented in only small areas, or not at all. This is because current protected areas have not been designed for efficient (or even complete) representation of species. As climate changes, it is not necessary or desirable to maintain large areas for over-represented species, nor is it logical to accept zero or very low representation for other species. A first step, therefore, is to add new areas to the existing protected areas system until practical representation targets are achieved. This provides a uniform baseline against which to judge our ability to maintain species representation. Species representation targets are the most relevant mea-Range shifts due to climate change may cause species to move out of protected areas. Climate change could therefore result in species range dynamics that reduce the relevance of current fixed protected areas in future conservation strategies. Here, we apply species distribution modeling and conservation planning tools in three regions (Mexico, the Cape Floristic Region of South Africa, and Western Europe) to examine the need for additional protected areas in light of anticipated species range shifts caused by climate change. We set species representation targets and assessed the area required to meet those targets in the present and in the future, under a moderate climate change scenario. Our findings indicate that protected areas can be an important conservation strategy in such a scenario, and that early action may be both more effective and less costly than inaction or delayed action. According to our projections, costs may vary among regions and none of the three areas studied will fully meet all conservation targets, even under a moderate climate change scenario. This suggests that limiting climate change is an essential complement to adding protected areas for conservation of biodiversity.},

Although various ecologically and economically important species depend on seagrass habitats at some life stages, these habitats are vulnerable to anthropogenic influences. As coastal human populations continue to grow, and nearshore habitats are affected, understanding the structure and function of assemblages associated with nearshore habitats is important for management and mitigation efforts. Therefore, we sampled estuarine and nearshore polyhaline seagrass beds monthly (May-November) from 2008 through 2015 using a 6.1-m otter trawl in seven estuaries in the eastern Gulf of Mexico. Despite latitudinal variability, assemblage structure of fishes and selected larger invertebrates was predominantly driven by estuary morphology-semi-enclosed estuaries had significantly higher catch-per-unit-effort (CPUE) of estuarine obligates and incidental marine taxa, whereas open estuaries had higher CPUE of small forage and cryptic species. Furthermore, abundances of several important fishery species differed markedly between semi-enclosed and open systems. Our results highlight (1) the relative importance of different scales of environmental factors' influence on communities, (2) the need for understanding how seemingly similar habitats in estuaries of differing morphologies can support different fishery species, and (3) the importance of regional-scale monitoring data and its value in tracking ecological changes.},

   abstract = {Marine Protected Areas (MPAs), if well designed and managed, can produce conservation benefits to fish assemblages within no-take zones and fishery benefits in neighboring areas through 'spillover'. However, although plenty of studies have provided evidence of the benefits produced within MPA boundaries, overall benefits to local fisheries, especially via spillover, seem to be still unclear. Because of the lost fishing grounds following an MPA establishment, local fishermen usually oppose MPAs. There is, therefore, the urgent need for a better understanding of the mechanism(s) through which MPAs can export fishable fish biomass towards adjacent fished areas, a process that could counterbalance the loss of fishing grounds. Here we review the literature on spillover for refining the terminology, detailing the underlying mechanisms and identifying both the existing and needed methodological approaches to measure spillover. Operationally, two types of spillover should be considered: ecological spillover (i.e. the net export of juvenile , subadult and adult biomass from MPAs outwards driven by density-dependent processes) and the fishery spillover (i.e. the proportion of this biomass that can be fished, taking into account regulations and accessibility). Underwater visual census and tagging/tracking may allow getting evidence of ecological spillover, while experimental catch data are essential to assess and monitor fishery spillover, which is the main component of MPAs that can provide direct benefit to local fisheries.},

   abstract = {1. The phenology of long-distance migrations can influence individual fitness, moderate population dynamics and regulate the availability of ecosystem services to other trophic levels. Phenology varies within and among populations, and can be influenced by conditions individuals experience both prior to departure and encounter en route. 2. Assessing how intrinsic and extrinsic factors (e.g., individual physical condition vs. environmental conditions) interact to influence variation in migratory phenologies across ecological scales is often limited due to logistical constraints associated with tracking large numbers of individuals from multiple populations simultaneously. 3. We used two natural tags, DNA and otolith microstructure analysis, to estimate the relative influence of individual traits (life-history strategy, body size at departure and growth during migration), population-specific behaviours and interannual variability on the phenology of marine migrations in juvenile sockeye salmon Oncorhynchus nerka. 4. We show that the timing and duration of juvenile sockeye salmon migrations were correlated with both life-history strategy and body size, while migration duration was also correlated with departure timing and growth rates during migration. Even after accounting for the effect of individual traits, several populations exhibited distinct migration phenologies. Finally, we observed substantial interannual and residual variation, suggesting stochastic environmental conditions moderate the influence of carry-over effects that develop prior to departure, as well as population specific strategies. 5. Migratory phenologies are shaped by complex interactions between drivers acting at multiple ecological and temporal scales. Given evidence that intraspecific diversity can stabilize ecological systems, conservation efforts should seek to maintain migratory variation among populations and preserve locally adapted phenotypes; however, variation within populations, which may buffer systems from environmental stochasticity, should also be regularly assessed and preserved.

   abstract = {Coral reefs worldwide are under threat from various anthropogenic factors, including overfishing and pollution. A new study by Mumby et al. highlights the trophic relationships between humans, carnivorous and herbi-vorous fishes, and the potential role of no-take areas in maintaining vulnerable coral reef ecosystems. No-take areas, where fishing is prohibited, are vital tools for managing food webs, ecosystem function and the resilience of reefs, in a seascape setting that extends far beyond the boundaries of the reefs themselves. Managing coral reefs The recipe for killing a coral reef is simple: distort food webs from the top down by overharvesting, or from the bottom up by adding nutrients, and add to the mix the stresses of climate change, emergent diseases and a myr-iad of other anthropogenic impacts. Overfishing and pollution have eroded the resilience of reefs, reducing their ability to absorb recurrent disturbances and remain coral dominated [1]. Consequently, tropical reef ecosystems worldwide are under siege, despite their enormous economic , social, cultural and aesthetic value. The key question arises: what should we do to protect and preserve the world's coral reefs? In a new paper [2], Mumby et al. highlight the trophic relationships between humans, car-nivorous and herbivorous fishes, and discuss the potential role of no-take areas, where fishing is prohibited, in maintaining vulnerable coral reef ecosystems. Herbivory and resilience Traditionally, proponents of no-take areas have focused on their utility for managing targeted fisheries [3], rather than on their potential to regulate the ecosystem functions of harvested stocks, their prey and the resilience of reef ecosystems [4]. Mumby et al. [2] tested the potential importance of marine no-take areas for safeguarding par-rotfish and their ability to control blooms of turf and fleshy seaweeds. Parrotfish (Figure 1) have several crucial roles in the dynamics of tropical reefs: they graze fleshy seaweeds that compete with juvenile and adult corals for space; they erode dead coral skeletons and generate reef sediments, and they are an important trophic link between their natural predators and algal primary producers [5]. Parrotfish also support subsistence fisheries on many coral reefs worldwide [4,5]. Logically, the density of parrot fishes will vary spatially and temporally in response to local rates of recruitment and mortality; the relative importance of mortality from fishing versus natural predation is also likely to differ substantially across the boundary of a no-take fishing reserve. Accordingly, Mumby et al. studied how parrotfish densities differ inside versus outside the Exuma Cays Land and Sea Park (ECLSP) in the Bahamas, a no-take area where fishing has been banned since 1986. Similar to many reefs around the world, coral cover in the ECLSP was sharply reduced following bleaching associated with the 1998 El Niñ o-Southern Oscillation event [2]. Mumby et al. present data, collected after nearly 20 years of protection, on the number and size of grazing parrotfish, their predators, and the abundance of seaweed, both inside and outside the park. These data describe the outcomes of a long-term reduction of fishing pressure inside the ECLSP, compared with controls outside. Like any such comparison, there is a chance that differences ascribed to fishing could have been caused by other unrecorded factors, such as different levels of recruitment by fish inside versus outside the ECLSP. However, Mumby et al. minimized the potentially confounding effects of spatial variation by utilizing a multi-scale sampling approach, with multiple sites inside and at varying distances outside the ECLSP. Although no local management scheme can prevent regional-scale mortality of corals from global warming, this study illustrates convincingly that stewardship of marine parks by local communities can enhance grazing and help to prevent regime shifts from coral-to algal-dominated systems (Figure 2). Fishing and trophic cascades The biomass of parrotfish predators (groupers, barracuda, moray eels and large snappers) inside the ECLSP was double that of two adjacent reefs (Figure 3), and five times greater than more distant parts of the Bahamas archipelago. Spatial gradients in the density and size of harvested predatory fishes have been documented from other no-take areas, and have been attributed to the spillover of adults into nearby areas, providing a boost to local fisheries [6]. Similarly, groupers tagged within the ECLP have been located over 200 km away [7]. The elevated biomass of},

   abstract = {The massive scale of the 1997-1998 El Niño-associated coral bleaching event underscores the need for strategies to mitigate biodiversity losses resulting from temperature-induced coral mortality. As baseline sea surface temperatures continue to rise, climate change may represent the single greatest threat to coral reefs worldwide. In response, one strategy might be to identify (1) specific reef areas where natural environmental conditions are likely to result in low or negligible temperature-related bleaching and mortality (i.e., areas of natural "resistance" to bleaching) and (2) reef areas where environmental conditions are likely to result in maximum recovery of reef communities after bleaching mortality has occurred (i.e., areas of natural community "resilience"). These "target areas," where environmental conditions appear to boost resistance and resilience during and after large-scale bleaching events, could then be incorporated into strategic networks of marine protected areas designed to maximize conservation of global coral reef biodiversity. Based on evidence from the literature and systematically compiled observations from researchers in the field, this paper identifies likely environmental correlates of resistance and resilience to coral bleaching, including factors that reduce temperature stress, enhance water movement, decrease light stress, correlate with physiological tolerance, and provide physical or biological enhancement of recovery potential. As a tool for identifying reef areas that are likely to be most robust in the face of continuing climate change and for determining priority areas for reducing direct anthropogenic impacts, this information has important implications for coral reef conservation and management. Resistencia y Capacidad de Recuperación al Blanqueado de Corales: Implicaciones para la Conservación y el Manejo de los Arrecifes de Coral Resumen: El blanqueo de corales a escala masiva asociado a El Niño en 1997-1998 acentúa la necesidad de desarrollar estrategias para mitigar las pérdidas de biodiversidad resultantes de la mortandad de corales inducida por la temperatura. A medida que sigue subiendo la temperatura superficial del océano, el cambio climático podría convertirse en la mayor amenaza para los arrecifes de coral en todo el mundo. Una estrate-gia posible sería identificar (1) aquellas áreas específicas de coral donde las condiciones ambientales proba-blemente resulten en un blanqueo y una mortandad insignificantes asociados a la temperatura (es decir, áreas de "resistencia" natural al blanqueo) y (2) aquellas áreas de coral donde es probable que las condi-ciones ambientales resulten en la máxima recuperación de las comunidades de arrecifes después de una mortandad por blanqueo, es decir, áreas de "recuperación"natural. Estas áreas de interés, en donde las condiciones ambientales parecieran favorecer la resistencia y la recuperación durante y después de eventos de blanqueo a gran escala, podrían ser incorporadas a redes estratégicas de áreas marinas protegidas cuyo objetivo sería maximizar la conservación de la biodiversidad global de arrecifes coralinos.

   abstract = {Stable isotope analysis is a useful tool to track animal movements in both terrestrial and marine environments. These intrinsic markers are assimilated through the diet and may exhibit spatial gradients as a result of biogeochemical processes at the base of the food web. In the marine environment, maps to predict the spatial distribution of stable isotopes are limited, and thus determining geographic origin has been reliant upon integrating satellite telemetry and stable isotope data. Migratory sea turtles regularly move between foraging and reproductive areas. Whereas most nesting populations can be easily accessed and regularly monitored, little is known about the demographic trends in foraging populations. The purpose of the present study was to examine migration patterns of loggerhead nesting aggregations in the Gulf of Mexico (GoM), where sea turtles have been historically understudied. Two methods of geographic assignment using stable isotope values in known-origin samples from satellite telemetry were compared: (1) a nominal approach through discriminant analysis and (2) a novel continuous-surface approach using bivariate carbon and nitrogen isoscapes (isotopic landscapes) developed for this study. Tissue samples for stable isotope analysis were obtained from 60 satellite-tracked individuals at five nesting beaches within the GoM. Both methodological approaches for assignment resulted in high accuracy of foraging area determination, though each has advantages and disadvantages. The nominal approach is more appropriate when defined boundaries are necessary, but up to 42% of the individuals could not be considered in this approach. All individuals can be included in the continuous-surface approach, and individual results can be aggregated to identify geographic hotspots of foraging area use, though the accuracy rate was lower than nominal assignment. The methodological validation provides a foundation for future sea turtle studies in the region to inexpensively determine geographic origin for large numbers of untracked individuals. Regular monitoring of sea turtle nesting aggregations with stable isotope sampling can be used to fill critical data gaps regarding habitat use and migration patterns. Probabilistic assignment to origin with isoscapes has not been previously used in the marine environment, but the methods presented here could also be applied to other migratory marine species.},

   abstract = {Stable isotopes are increasingly being used to trace wildlife movements. A fundamental prerequisite of animal isotopic tracking is a good knowledge of spatial isotopic variations in the environment. Few accessible reference maps of the isotopic landscape (''isoscapes'') are available for marine predators. Here, we validate for the first time an isotopic gradient for higher trophic levels by using a unique combination of a large number of satellite-tracks and subsequent blood plasma isotopic signatures from a wide-ranging oceanic predator. The plasma d 13 C and d 15 N values of wandering albatrosses (n ¼ 45) were highly and positively correlated to the Southern Ocean latitudes at which the satellite-tracked individuals foraged. The well-defined latitudinal baseline carbon isoscapes in the Southern Ocean is thus reflected in the tissue of consumers, but with a positive shift due to the cumulative effect of a slight 13 C-enrichment at each trophic level. The data allowed us to estimate the carbon isotopic position of the main oceanic fronts in the area, and thus to delineate robust isoscapes of the main foraging zones for top predators. The plasma d 13 C and d 15 N values were positively and linearly correlated, thus suggesting that latitudinal isoscapes also occur for d 15 N at the base of the food web in oceanic waters of the Southern Ocean. The combination of device deployments with sampling of relevant tissues for isotopic analysis appears to be a powerful tool for investigating consumers' isoscapes at various spatio-temporal scales.},

Naturally occurring stable isotopes of H (d 2 H) in feathers provide an alternative intrinsic marker of animal origin due to the predictable spatial linkage to underlying hydrologically driven flow of H isotopes into foodwebs. This approach can assess the likelihood that a migrant animal originated from a given location(s) within a continent but requires a robust algorithm linking H isotopes in tissues of interest to an appropriate hydrological isotopic spatio-temporal pattern, such as weighted-annual rainfall. However, a number of factors contribute to or alter expected isotopic patterns in animals.

Stable isotope analysis (SIA) offers a complementary approach to infer areas used year-round, but its suitability in oceanic environments remains almost unexplored. To evaluate SIA as a tool for inferring movements of oceanic migrants, we sampled an oceanic seabird, the Bulwer's petrel, Bulweria bulwerii, in four breeding colonies spread along its Atlantic distribution. We first studied the species moulting pattern from 29 corpses collected in the colonies. Secondly, based on this moult knowledge, we selected three feathers from tracked birds to infer their breeding and non-breeding grounds using SIA: the 1 st primary (P1), the 8 th secondary (S8) and the 6 th rectrix (R6) feathers. Birds migrated to two main non-breeding areas, the Central or the South Atlantic Ocean. P1 showed similar isotopic values among petrels from different breeding colonies, suggesting this feather is replaced early in the non-breeding period in a common area used by most birds, the Central Atlantic. S8 and R6 feathers correctly assigned 92% and 81%, respectively, of the birds to their non-breeding areas, suggesting they were replaced late in season, when birds were settled in their main non-breeding grounds. Our results showed that the isotopic baseline levels of the Central and South Atlantic are propagated through the food web until reaching top predators, suggesting these ratios can be used to infer the movement of long-distance migrants among oceanic water masses.},

Many ecological indicators have been proposed to detect and describe the effects of fishing on marine ecosystems, but few have been evaluated formally. Here, simulation models of two marine systems off southeastern Australia (a large marine embayment, and an EEZ-scale regional marine ecosystem) are used to evaluate the performance of a suite of ecological indicators. The indicators cover species, assemblages, habitats, and ecosystems, including quantities derived from models such as Ecopath. The simulation models, based on the Atlantis framework, incorporate the effects of fishing from several fishing gears, and also the confounding impacts of other broad-scale pressures on the ecosystems (e.g. increased nutrient loads). These models are used to provide fishery-dependent and fishery-independent pseudo-data from which the indicators are calculated. Indicator performance is quantified by the ability to detect and/or predict trends in key variables of interest (''attributes''), the true values of which are known from the simulation models. The performance of each indicator is evaluated across a range of ecological and fishing scenarios. Results suggest that indicators at the community level of organization are the most reliable, and that it is necessary to use a variety of indicators simultaneously to detect the full range of impacts from fishing. Several key functional groups provide a good characterization of ecosystem state, or indicate the cause of broader ecosystem changes in most instances.},

We hypothesised that fin and muscle d 13 C and d 15 N would be strongly correlated in tropical fishes, thus allowing non-lethal sampling of these species. To test this hypothesis, we analysed fin and muscle tissues from 174 tropical fishes representing 27 species from the Mitchell River, Queensland, Australia. Fin tissue was a strong predictor of muscle-tissue d 13 C (r 2 ¼ 0.91 for all species) and was slightly enriched in 13 C (0.9%), consistent with the results of studies on temperate species. Fin tissue was a poorer predictor of muscle-tissue d 15 N (r 2 ¼ 0.56 for all species) although the mean difference between the tissues was small (o0.1%). Differences were smallest in the largest fish, possibly because the elemental composition (%N) of fin more closely resembled that of muscle. These measurements provide more impetus for increased use of fin tissue as a non-destructive means of testing hypotheses about fish food webs in the tropics and elsewhere.},

The trophic enrichment values were ranked liver < muscle < fin for δ 13 C (range-0.80‰ to +3.66‰) and liver < fin < muscle for δ 15 N (+0.59‰ to +3.12‰). The half-life values were similar for muscle and fin for both δ 13 C and δ 15 N (19.3-25.7 days), while those for liver were 5.3 days for δ 13 C and 14.4 days for δ 15 N. Both the δ 13 C and δ 15 N values of muscle reached the asymptotic value after a threefold body weight increase, reflecting the diet after the switch. These results suggest that fin is a useful substitute for muscle in field applications of stable isotope techniques and that liver, with a shorter half-life, has the potential to provide more recent information about migration.

Les valeurs de * 13 C et de * 15 N du muscle atteignent toutes deux une valeur d'asymptote, après une augmentation de masse corporelle par un facteur de trois, reflétant ainsi le régime alimentaire après le changement. Ces résultats indiquent que la nageoire peut être utilisée comme substitut du muscle dans les études de terrain qui emploient les techniques d'isotopes stables et que le foie, à cause de sa demi-vie plus courte, peut fournir des renseignements plus récents sur la migration.

Natural stable carbon isotope ratio of migratory fishes reflected differences of feeding habitat in relation to known life-history patterns. Use of the stable isotope methodology as a tool for proxy analysis of fish behavior in present and future Arctic environmental monitoring studies is suggested from analysis of age-specific isotopic ratio differences in broad whitefish (Coregonus nasus) and Arctic cisco (Coregonus autumnalis).

   abstract = {The ratios of stable isotopes 18 O: 16 O and 13 C: 12 C were measured in otolith carbon taken from nine species of fishes caught within mangroves and on the reef at Gazi Bay, Kenya. Before analysis, otoliths were divided into 'larval' 'post-larval' and 'adult' sections using a drill. Fishes were putatively classified as 'mangrove residents' 'offshore residents' or 'migrants' on the basis of information from the literature, and depending on where they were caught (mangroves only, offshore only or both mangroves and offshore) in the present study. Eight of the species exhibited an increase in otolith 13 C: 12 C with age, but this was significant only in the two migrant species Lethrinus harak and Lutjanus fulviflammus. There were no consistent patterns in 18 O: 16 O with age, or between migrants and non-migrants. These results suggest that comparing absolute values of otolith oxygen and carbon isotope signatures between fish species is not a useful way of determining migration patterns at this site, because of species-specific differences in carbon metabolism and insufficiently steep gradients in temperature and salinity. Changes in carbon isotope signatures between life stages within a species, however, do hold promise as migration tracers.},

Stable isotopes of sulfur, carbon, and nitrogen were used to investigate the incorporation of nutrients into food chains (fish, invertebrates, and plants) and the influence of migration on the nutritional origins of fish in two freshwater systems in the Mackenzie Delta region. Sulfur isotope analyses of fish muscle showed that broad whitefish (Coregonus nasus) in Travaillant bake and lake wl~itefish (Coregonus clupeaforrnis) in the Kukjukt~~ k Creek system were migrant populations which had grown mostly on sources outside the local food base. A marine food source was indicated for the lake whitefish, while no specific source was determined tor the broad whitefish. The 615N clearly defined the trophic levels in the local food chains in both systems. Fish were in three levels in Travaillant bake. Amphipods were in a level below the lowest fish and sediments and macrophytes were in the lowest level. The Kukjuktuk Creek fish were in two levels above a level including macrophytes, amphipods, and zooplankton. The 613C varied widely even within single fish species local to Travaillant hake.

   abstract = {Anadromous herrings of the genus Alosa are generally thought to leave their natal river or estuary at the end of the first growing season and return as mature adults to spawn. Nevertheless, immature yearling alosines have been observed in large numbers in the Hudson River estuary during and after the spring spawning run. I analyzed the stable isotopic (δ 13 C, δ 15 N) compositions of 26 blueback herring (Alosa aestivalis), eight American shad (Alosa sapidissima), and 10 alewife (Alosa pseudoharengus) collected from 55-225 km above the estuary mouth during April-July and compared them with isotopic compositions of young-of-year (resident) alosines, as well as adults (marine phase). δ 13 C of the May-caught American shad and alewife indicated a marine origin (greater than-22.5‰); blueback herring split into both marine and freshwater (δ 13 C less than-25.5‰) groups. June-caught fish had intermediate values. Microprobe traces of Sr in these fishes' otoliths helped further to discriminate between resident fishes and those that had migrated to sea (or brackish water) and then moved back upriver for a period of several weeks. The combination of biogeochemical tracer methods holds promise for elucidating complex life histories of fishes and helps to pose questions about plasticity of migration. Résumé : On pense généralement que les cupléidés anadromes du genre Alosa quittent leur rivière ou leur estuaire natals à la fin de la première saison de croissance pour n'y revenir qu'à l'âge adulte, après avoir atteint la maturité sexuelle, afin d'y frayer. Or, on a observé des Alosa d'un an en grand nombre dans l'estuaire de l'Hudson durant la remonte printanière et après la fraye. J'ai analysé des compositions d'isotopes stables (δ 13 C, δ 15 N) chez 26 aloses d'été (Alosa aestivalis), huit aloses savoureuses (Alosa sapidissima) et 10 gaspareaux (Alosa pseudoharengus) capturés d'avril à juillet à une distance de 55-225 km en amont de l'embouchure de l'estuaire; j'ai comparé ces compositions à celles mises en évidence chez des jeunes de l'année (population résidante) et chez des adultes (phase marine). Les concentrations de δ 13 C mesurées chez les aloses savoureuses et les gaspareaux capturés en mai dénotaient une origine marine (plus de-22,5‰); on a pu distinguer deux groupes : les aloses d'été les d'origine marine et les aloses d'été d'eau douce (δ 13 C moins de-25,5‰). Chez les spécimens capturés en juin, les concentrations étaient intermédiaires. Par ailleurs, en utilisant une microsonde, on a décelé des traces de Sr dans les otolithes de ces poissons, ce qui nous a permis d'établir une distinction encore plus fine entre les poissons résidants et ceux qui, après avoir migré en mer (ou en eau saumâtre), étaient revenus séjourner plusieurs semaines dans les eaux d'amont. La combinaison de différents traceurs biogéochimiques est une approche prometteuse pour l'étude des poissons à cycle naturel complexe et permet d'aborder de nouveaux aspects de la plasticité de leur migration.

   abstract = {To distinguish Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) populations in tributaries of the Connecticut River, we studied the incorporation and stability of Sr isotopes in juvenile salmon. We established the geologic basis for unique isotopic signatures in 29 salmon sites. Stream-specific Sr isotopic ratios (87 Sr/ 86 Sr) were found in calcified tissues of salmon parr within 3 months of stocking. We found little seasonal variation in the Sr signatures of stream water or fish tissue. There were no significant differences among the Sr signatures of otoliths, scales, and vertebrae. For mature salmon raised under constant conditions, 70% of the Sr isotopic signature in calcified tissues was derived from food sources. We developed a criterion for identifying moving fish based upon the isotopic variability of genetically marked fish. Applying this criterion to our streams, 7% of the fish in our study had incorporated Sr from multiple streams. Strontium isotopes distinguished all 8 regions in the White River basin and 7 of the 10 regions in the West River basin. When watersheds are considered together, Sr isotopes differentiated 11 unique signatures from 18 regions. We conclude that Sr isotopes are an effective marking tool and discuss ways in which they can be combined with other marking techniques over larger spatial scales. Résumé : L'incorporation et la stabilité des isotopes du strontium (Sr) chez les Saumons de l'Atlantique (Salmo salar) juvéniles ont permis de distinguer les populations de différents tributaires du fleuve Connecticut. Les signatures isotopi-ques particulières de 29 sites à saumons ont pu être reliées à des conditions géologiques. Des rapports isotopiques de strontium (87 Sr/ 86 Sr) spécifiques à chaque cours d'eau apparaissent dans les tissus calcifiés des tacons moins de 3 mois après l'empoissonnement. Il y a cependant peu de variation saisonnière de la signature de Sr dans l'eau ou dans les tis-sus des poissons. Aucune différence significative n'apparaît entre les signatures de Sr dans les otolithes, les écailles ou les vertèbres. Chez les saumons à maturité élevés en conditions constantes, 70% de la signature isotopique de Sr dans les tissus calcifiés provient de l'alimentation. En étudiant la variabilité isotopique chez des poissons marqués génétique-ment, il est possible d'établir un critère d'identification des poissons qui se déplacent d'une rivière à une autre.

   abstract = {Establishing patterns of movement of wild animals is crucial for our understanding of their ecology, life history and behavior, and is a prerequisite for their effective conservation. Advances in the use of stable isotope markers make it possible to track a diversity of animal species in a variety of habitats. This approach is revolutionizing the way in which we make connections between phases of the annual cycle of migratory animals. However, researchers must exercise care in their application of isotopic methods. Here, we review stable isotope patterns in nature and discuss recent tracking applications in a range of taxa. To aid in the interpretation and design of effective and insightful isotope movement studies, we discuss a series of key issues and assumptions. This exciting field will advance rapidly if researchers consider these aspects of study design and interpretation carefully. Unraveling patterns of movement at various scales is essential for our understanding of the ecology, life history, behavior and conservation of most animals. However, this requires individuals or populations to be tracked on a seasonal or annual basis [1], a difficult task if the animal is small, the distances covered are vast or the habitat is remote. Tracking animal movements can be done either directly, by following individuals over time and space using some form of extrinsic marker, or indirectly, by inferring their origins using natural, intrinsic biological or biogeochemi-cal markers (i.e. forming links between populations or seasons) (Box 1). Biogeochemical markers are particularly useful for studying animal movements because they do not require marking or recapturing individuals and they provide time-integrated information that can be linked directly to geographical regions. The most commonly used Box 1. Using markers to track animal movements Extrinsic markers Remote-sensing techniques (e.g. radio transmitters or satellite technology) and individual tags (e.g. leg rings, neck collars or plumage dyes) are the most common types of extrinsic marker used to track animal movement patterns. Radio telemetry works well for large animals and those that move shorter distances, but not as well for smaller, long-distance migrants. Although advances in such techniques (e.g. satellite technology) offer new promise and do not rely on recapturing or re-sighting individuals, size and cost are still prohibitive [1]. Tagging requires initial capture, and then recapturing or re-sighting specific individuals, and so often suffers from the 'needle-in-a-haystack' effect. For example, intensive ringing efforts have provided good data for many larger migratory birds, such as waterfowl and shorebirds [1], but not for many of the smaller, threatened songbirds [29,52]. Extrinsic markers can also affect behavior, and although they supply excellent data about movements of a few individuals, such information might not be typical of entire populations. Biological markers (intrinsic) Biological markers (e.g. morphological, behavioral and genetic variation) rely less on capturing specific individuals and more on locating members of the same population or those from a similar geographical area [1,23,54]. However, migratory animals and species that move or disperse vast distances tend to show few differences (i.e. low intra-specific variation in genetic structure or trait diversity) among populations [1], and such markers might only work over geographical scales of thousands of kilometers [23,54]. Biogeochemical markers (intrinsic) Biogeochemical markers (e.g. trace element concentrations and stable isotopes) have been used to infer geographical origins and to differentiate among populations of animals, and recent developments in analytical techniques now enable routine measurement of many elements and their isotopes [52,55]. Stable isotope measurements in animal tissues reflect those isotope values in food webs, and so provide information about diet and location of feeding. Tissue isotope signatures in animals caught at one location can be compared with those of individuals caught at another to provide information about population-level movements between geographically separated areas. That is, because stable isotopes indirectly provide information about animal movements (as opposed to directly in the case of using extrinsic markers), isotope signatures from many individuals caught in one area or population are needed, and thus provide movement patterns relevant to populations, rather than individuals. Moreover, stable isotope methods do not rely on recapture or re-sighting previously captured individuals.},

Neurophysiol. 49, 1218 (1971); A. L. Nuttall and D. F. Dolan, ibid. 99, 1556 (1996). 16. The present data demonstrate that magnitude plateaus do not exist in neural tuning curves even when the otic capsule is opened and the BM is loaded by the reflective microbeads. Perhaps BM vibrations in the plateau region are not transmitted to hair cell stereocilia (17). 17.. 33. All animal procedures were approved by Northwestern University's Animal Care and Use Committee. Each chinchilla was deeply anesthetized with diallyl barbitu-ric acid in urethane. The left pinna was resected and the head was attached to a metallic holder. A calibrated miniature microphone, with its tip placed within 2 mm of the eardrum, was used for in situ determination of SPLs (expressed relative to 20 Pa). The auditory bulla was opened widely and a gross electrode, which recorded compound action potential thresholds of responses to tone pips, was placed on the round window. Both middle-ear muscles (cochlea L208) or only the tensor tympani (L199) was detached. Then the surgical preparations necessary for microelectrode recording from auditory nerve fibers (31) and for measuring BM vibrations with a laser velocimeter (32) were made consecutively. After the otic capsule was opened and reflective microbeads were dropped onto the BM, the otic capsule hole was covered with a window (made from slide coverslip glass) to minimize motion of the perilymph (7). Stimuli for BM recordings were 128 to 512 repetitions of gated tones (5 to 100 ms in duration, presented every 53 to 500 ms). BM tuning curves were computed from velocity-intensity functions (resolution: 5 or 10 dB, 100 to 1000 Hz) by interpolating at each frequency the response magnitude corresponding to neural threshold at CF. Frequency-threshold tuning curves of auditory nerve fibers were measured with 50-ms tone pips, presented every 100 ms, by an automated procedure (11). They had a resolution of 32 frequency steps per octave near CF and 8 steps per octave at lower frequencies. For migratory birds, early arrival and physical condition on the breeding grounds are important determinants of reproductive success and fitness. Differences in arrival times often exceed a month, and later arriving individuals are often in poorer condition. Habitat-specific isotopic signatures indicate that the quality of winter habitats occupied by American redstarts (Setophaga ruticilla) determines their physical condition and spring departure dates, which in turn result in variable arrival schedules and condition on temperate breeding grounds. These findings link events in tropical winter grounds with those in temperate breeding areas for a migratory songbird and provide evidence that winter habitats may be limiting.},

   abstract = {Our ability to link the breeding locations of individual passerines to migration stopover sites and wintering locations is limited. Stable isotopes of hydrogen contained in bird feathers have recently shown potential in this regard. We measured hydrogen stable-isotope ratios (δD) of feathers from breeding, migrating, and wintering Wilson's Warblers. Analyses of feathers from museum specimens collected throughout the western portion of the breeding range indicate that δD values are significantly negatively related to latitude of collection (R 2 =0.52), which is an indication that δD values are a good descriptor of breeding latitude. Analyses of feathers collected from birds migrating through the Bosque del Apache National Wildlife Refuge, New Mexico (USA), revealed a significantly positive relationship between δD values and the timing of autumn migration (R 2 =0.34), but not the timing of spring migration. This pattern indicates that Wilson's Warblers that bred furthest north migrated earliest in the autumn. Finally, analysis of feathers collected on the wintering grounds indicate that the hydrogen isotope ratio is significantly positively related to wintering latitude (R 2 =0.80), which indicates that birds that bred furthest north wintered furthest south. In combination, these patterns suggest that in the western portion of their range, Wilson's Warblers have a leapfrog migration system in which the northern-most breeding birds pass through New Mexico early in the autumn to arrive on the wintering grounds in southern Central America, the southern edge of the Wilson's Warblers winter range. We know of no other literature documenting or suggesting that Wilson's Warbler engage in leapfrog migration. We think the novelty of these results is a reflection of the potential for stable-isotope techniques to revise our understanding of bird migration.},

   abstract = {To understand the ecology of migratory animals it is important to link geographic regions used by individuals including breeding, wintering, and intermediate stopover sites. Previous conventional approaches used to track animal movements have relied on extrinsic markers and typically the subsequent recovery of individuals. This approach has generally been inappropriate for most small, or non-game animals. The use of intrinsic markers such as fatty acid pro®les, molecular DNA analyses, and the measurement of naturally occurring stable isotopes in animal tissues oer alternative approaches. This paper reviews the use of stable isotope analyses (primarily d 13 C, d 15 N, d 34 S, dD, d 87 Sr) to trace nutritional origin and migration in animals. This approach relies on the fact that foodweb isotopic signatures are re¯ected in the tissues of organisms and that such signatures can vary spatially based on a variety of biogeochemical processes. Organisms moving between isotopically distinct foodwebs can carry with them information on the location of previous feeding. Such an approach has been used to track animal use of inshore versus oshore, marine versus freshwater, terrestrial C 3 versus marine, terrestrial mesic versus xeric, and C 3 versus C 4 or Crassulacean acid metabolism foodwebs. More recently, the use of stable hydrogen isotope analyses (dD) to link organisms to broad geographic origin in North America is based on large-scale isotopic contours of growing-season average dD values in precipitation. This technique, especially when combined with the assay of other stable isotopes, will be extremely useful in helping to track migration and movement of a wide range of animals from insects to birds and mammals. Future research to re®ne our understanding of natural and anthropogenic-induced isotopic gradients in nature, and to explore the use of stable isotopes of other elements, is recommended.},

   abstract = {Identifying the most sensitive indicators to changes in fishing pressure is important for accurately detecting impacts. Biomass is thought to be more sensitive than abundance and length, while the wariness of fishes is emerging as a new metric. Periodically harvested closures (PHCs) that involve the opening and closing of an area to fishing are the most common form of fisheries management in the western Pacific. The opening of PHCs to fishing provides a unique opportunity to compare the sensitivity of metrics, such as abundance, length, biomass and wari-ness, to changes in fishing pressure. Diver-operated stereo video (stereo-DOV) provides data on fish behavior (using a proxy for wariness, minimum approach distance) simultaneous to abundance and length estimates. We assessed the impact of PHC protection and harvesting on the abundance, length, biomass, and wariness of target species using stereo-DOVs. This allowed a comparison of the sensitivity of these metrics to changes in fishing pressure across four PHCs in Fiji, where spearfishing and fish drives are common. Before PHCs were opened to fishing they consistently decreased the wariness of targeted species but were less likely to increase abundance, length, or biomass. Pulse harvesting of PHCs resulted in a rapid increase in the wariness of fishes but inconsistent impacts across the other metrics. Our results suggest that fish wariness is the most sensitive indicator of fishing pressure, followed by biomass, length, and abundance. The collection of behavioral data simultaneously with abundance, length, and biomass estimates using stereo-DOVs offers a cost-effective indicator of protection or rapid increases in fishing pressure. Stereo-DOVs can rapidly provide large amounts of behavioral data from monitoring programs historically focused on estimating abundance and length of fishes, which is not feasible with visual methods.},

   abstract = {Human fishing effort is size-selective, preferentially removing the largest individuals from harvested stocks. Intensive, size-specific fishing mortality induces directional shifts in phe-notypic frequencies towards the predominance of smaller and earlier-maturing individuals, which are among the primary causes of declining fish biomass. Fish that reproduce at smaller size and younger age produce fewer, smaller, and less viable larvae, severely reducing the reproductive capacity of harvested populations. Marine protected areas (MPAs) are extensively utilized in coral reefs for fisheries management, and are thought to mitigate the impacts of size-selective fishing mortality and supplement fished stocks through larval export. However, empirical evidence of disparities in fitness-relevant phenotypes between MPAs and adjacent fished reefs is necessary to validate this assertion. Here, we compare key life-history traits in three coral-reef fishes (Acanthurus nigrofuscus, Cteno-chaetus striatus, and Parupeneus multifasciatus) between MPAs and fished reefs in the Philippines. Results of our analyses support previous hypotheses regarding the impacts of MPAs on phenotypic traits. Asymptotic length (L inf) and growth rates (K) differed between conspecifics in MPAs and fished reefs, with protected populations exhibiting phenotypes that are known to confer higher fecundity. Additionally, populations demonstrated increases in length at 50% maturity (L 50) inside MPAs compared to adjacent areas, although age at 50% maturity (A 50) did not appear to be impacted by MPA establishment. Shifts toward advantageous phenotypes were most common in the oldest and largest MPAs, but occurred in all of the MPAs examined. These results suggest that MPAs may provide protection against the impacts of size-selective harvest on life-history traits in coral-reef fishes.},

   abstract = {Small-scale fisheries contribute to economies and food security of most of the world's rural-poor coastal communities but are poorly documented in national and regional catch statistics. As a result, management of marine commons is inherently biased towards short-term interests of industrial fleets, rather than the long-term maintenance of coastal ecosystem health. Artisanal fishers' knowledge can provide practical information for management, and when shared, can help build trust between fishers and managers. However, until recently, very few studies designed to support fisheries management have incorporated fishers' knowledge. This study was designed to characterize the geography of fishing in the Gulf of Hon-duras (GOH), shared by Belize, Guatemala, and Honduras, from the perspective of artisanal fishers. Data were compiled from semi-formal interviews with key informants, community meetings, mapping exercises , workshops with fishers in the GOH during 1998-1999, and participant observations through July 2011. Data were used to document fishery landings, status and trends in marine resources, the spatial and the temporal dynamic geography of fishing, and fishers' suggestions for improved conservation and management. Many of these suggestions have been implemented in the GOH between 1999 and 2011. This study offers a practical methodology that can be used in other artisanal, data-sparse fishing areas to document the geography of fishing, increase the participation of fishers in management, and lead to better participatory, ecosystem-based management.},

Anecdotal reports from long-time fishers of Florida Bay suggest a dramatic reduction in bonefish abundance in recent years. In absence of a reliable long-term dataset, experienced fishers can provide critical information on historical changes in this fishery. To characterize and quantify historical trends and the contemporary status of the Florida Bay bonefish population and fishery, 64 of the fishery's most reputable and experienced fishers were surveyed using a questionnaire. All but one respondent reported the bonefish population in Florida Bay had declined over the course of their fishing career. Respondents indicated a 78 % decline in bonefish abundance in Florida Bay with no correlation between perceived decline and fisher experience. A significant period of bonefish decline was noted 2001-2012 with 76 % of respondents indicating the largest decline in the population occurred 2007-2011. Fishing effort for bonefish decreased 37 % over the course of respondents' careers, with 74 % of those respondents indicating this reduced effort was due to lack of fish. Forty-four percent of respondents suggested water quality issues as the primary reason for the observed decline. Two of the larger bonefish decline periods (mid 1990s and 2006-08) corresponded to periods of sustained algal blooms in Florida Bay. The most significant decline in bonefish abundance throughout the range of the Florida Keys was reported to have occurred in Florida Bay. Several possible factors leading to the perceived decline in the Florida Bay bonefish population are discussed, and the continued need to focus on this population throughout Everglades restoration efforts is emphasized.},

Fish were initially fed a diet of Atlantic mackerel, Scomber scombrus, (mean δ 13 C=−21.3‰±0.2, n=20) for a period of 56 days and then shifted to a diet of pinfish, Lagodon rhomboids, (mean δ 13 C=−16.6‰±0.6, n= 20) for the 256 day experiment. We developed a non-lethal surgical procedure to obtain biopsies of the muscle, liver, and gonad tissue monthly from the same four fish. We then determined the δ 13 C value of each tissue by isotope ratio mass spectrometry. For the gonad tissue we used the relationship between C/N and lipid content to correct for the influence of lipids on δ 13 C value. We observed a significant shift in the δ 13 C values of all of the tissues sampled in the study. Carbon turnover rates varied among the three tissues, but the shift in diet from mackerel to pinfish was clearly traceable through analysis of δ 13 C values. The turnover rates for muscle tissue were 0.005‰ day −1 , and for gonad tissue was 0.009‰ day −1. Although it is generally thought that tissue turnover rates in ectotherms are driven primarily by growth, we found that metabolic rate can be a major factor driving tissue turnover in adult gag.},

   abstract = {Research that uses stable isotope analysis often involves a delay between sample collection in the field and laboratory processing, therefore requiring preservation to prevent or reduce tissue degradation and associated isotopic compositions. Although there is a growing literature describing the effects of various preservation techniques, the results are often contextual, unpredictable and vary among taxa, suggesting the need to treat each species individually. We conducted a controlled experiment to test the effects of four preservation methods of muscle tissue from four species of upper trophic-level reef fish collected from the eastern Gulf of Mexico (Red Grouper Epinephelus morio, Gag Mycteroperca microlepis, Scamp Mycteroperca phenax, and Red Snapper Lutjanus campechanus). We used a paired design to measure the effects on isotopic values for carbon and nitrogen after storage using ice, 95% ethanol, and sodium chloride (table salt), against that in a liquid nitrogen control. Mean offsets for both δ 13 C and δ 15 N values from controls were lowest for samples preserved on ice, intermediate for those preserved with salt, and highest with ethanol. Within species, both salt and ethanol significantly enriched the δ 15 N values in nearly all comparisons. Ethanol also had strong effects on the δ 13 C values in all three groupers. Conversely, for samples preserved on ice, we did not detect a significant offset in either isotopic ratio for any of the focal species. Previous studies have addressed preservation-induced offsets in isotope values using a mass balance correction that accounts for changes in the isotope value to that in the C/N ratio. We tested the application of standard mass balance corrections for isotope values that were significantly affected by the preservation methods and found generally poor agreement between corrected and control values. The poor performance by the correction may have been due to preferential loss of lighter isotopes and corresponding low levels of mass loss with a substantial change in the isotope value of the sample. Regardless of mechanism, it was evident that accounting for offsets caused by different preservation methods was not possible using the standard correction. Caution is warranted when interpreting the results from specimens stored in either ethanol or salt, especially when using those from multiple preservation techniques. We suggest the use of ice as the preferred How to cite this article Stallings et al.

Average delta C-13 values among sites ranged -21.7 to -15.7 aEuro degrees, delta N-15 ranged < 3 aEuro degrees: from 9.8 to 11.5 aEuro degrees, and delta S-34 ranged from 5.9 to 18.3 aEuro degrees. Isotope variation among these sites provided insight into the ranging habits of bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus) sampled in St. George Sound (29.8N, 84.6W), a nearshore seagrass habitat, during May of 2005. Isotope comparisons suggest that the majority of dolphins sampled (average +/- A one standard deviation: delta C-13 = -17.5 +/- A 0.8, delta N-15 = 14.5 +/- A 0.9, and delta S-34 = 10.6 +/- A 1.5) did not forage significantly on offshore species which are significantly S-34-enriched, nor is it likely that they ranged either eastward or westward along the coast within the sampling region. Despite their capability for ranging, these dolphins occupied a restricted home range, during the spring before our sampling efforts. These results demonstrate significant fine-scale isotope variation among coastal habitats explained by differences in freshwater inputs, organic matter loading, and modes of primary production that may be used to constrain the foraging ranges of a highly mobile apex predator.},

Muscle δ15N from three widely distributed fish species, Synodus foetens (inshore lizardfish), Calamus proridens (littlehead porgy), and Syacium papillosum (dusky flounder), exhibited strong longitudinal correlations (Pearson's r=-0.67 to -0.90, p<0.001) that coincided with the principal trophic gradient, whereas δ13C values of fish muscle and benthic algae were correlated with depth (Pearson's r=-0.34 to -0.73, p<0.05). Correlations between isotopic values and surface concentrations of chlorophyll and particulate organic carbon (POC) imply linkages between the isotopic baseline and transitions from eutrophic to oligotrophic waters.

During this migration, striped bass spend significant time in estuaries and saltmarshes, presumably to forage. However, the extent to which saltmarsh productivity supports striped bass remains unresolved. We used a three-isotope Bayesian mixing model to determine the relative contribution of three primary producers [C4 saltmarsh cordgrass (Spartina spp.), phytoplankton, and benthic diatoms] to striped bass tissue. Phytoplankton (51 \{%\} contribution) and Spartina-derived sources (44 \{%\} contribution) are the primary sources of production to striped bass, while benthic diatoms made a relatively small contribution (5 \{%\}). Our results highlight the importance of saltmarshes to striped bass by showing that primary producers unique to saltmarsh ecosystems support a large proportion of striped bass production.},

All fish were captured and released on the patch reef surrounding Coconut Island in Kaneohe Bay, Oahu, Hawaii, which has been a no-fishing conservation zone for over 30 years. Sonic tracking produced fine-scale movement data from five fish for periods spanning up to 18 days. All fish displayed die1 movement patterns within consistent home ranges, which encompassed different parts of the reef during the night than during the clay. Movements were predominantly along the walls of the patch reef, with occasional forays to nearby sections of adjacent reefs. Four hundred and ten fish were tagged and released on the Coconut Island reef, and the recapture sites of 85 recaptured fish indicated that most did not move far from their point of release; 75.5% were recaptured within 0.5 km of their release points. Time at liberty ranged from 4 to 454 days, and distance between release and recapture sites was not related to time at liberty. Some fish were observed many times in the same areas over periods of several months. Both the tracking and recapture data indicate strong site fidelity in this species and low occurrence of long distance emigration. These behavioral traits suggest that successful husbandry of this species may be accomplished through the use of management practices such as establishing no-fishing zones.},

   abstract = {Members of the family Carangidae are top-level predators and highly prized food and sport fishes. Although ecologically and economically important, little is known about the biology of numerous species in the family. This is particularly true of the jacks Caranx ignobilis and C. melampygus, which have experienced recent population reductions around the high Hawaiian Islands due to overfishing. Previous studies have documented territorial tendencies as well as cases of long-distance excursions in both species, suggesting populations may exhibit a range of structure at the genetic level. To explore this possibility, mitochondrial DNA ATPase6 and ATPase8 gene sequence variation was assessed from 91 individuals (33 C. ignobilis and 58 C. melampygus) spanning the islands of Kaua'i, O'ahu, Moloka'i, Maui, and Hawai'i. Although a total of 20 distinct haplotypes (8 for C. ignobilis; 12 for C. melampygus) were recovered, no evidence of population structure was found for either species across the examined geographic range. However, distinct demographic patterns were identified, implying differing evolutionary histories and/or population dynamics. Additionally, ;6% of the examined C. ignobilis were C. ignobilis Â C. melampygus hybrids because they harbored mitochondrial haplotypes typical of C. melampygus. These hybrids contribute to measurable gene flow between the species and may play a significant role in the evolution of the genus. Humans have historically exploited fish species for consumption , economics, and recreation (e.g., Pringle 1997). Unfortunately, intensive commercial fishing as well as varying indirect anthropogenic stresses (i.e., eutrophication, habitat change, the proliferation of invasive species, etc.) have driven freshwater and marine fisheries on a global scale into sharp declines over recent decades (reviewed by Hilborn et al. 2003; Pauly 2008). Impacting the spectrum of species from small pelagic foragers (e.g., anchovies, herring, mackerel, sardines, etc.; Tacon and Metian 2009) to large top-level predators (e.g., tuna, billfishes, swordfish, etc.; Myers and Worm 2003, 2004), this precarious trend has ignited concern around the world due to issues ranging from the lose of intrinsic and/or cultural value (Lewin et al. 2006) to collapses in ecosystem function and health (Mullon et al. 2005). For future management practices to be successful will require the integration of sociopolitical, physical (i.e., oceanographic, habitat, etc.), and organismal (i.e., natural history, behavior, etc.) information into a holistic framework (reviewed by Botsford et al. 1997; Thrush and Dayton 2010). However, knowledge concerning the basic biology of many fisheries-related species, such as their genetic structure, is lacking (Reiss et al. 2009), thus hindering such efforts. The perciform family Carangidae consists of ;200 species of predominately marine fishes found in temperate and tropical waters around the world. Known as jacks, trevallies, pompanos, jack mackerels, and scads, many larger species are important top-level predators and are highly prized food and sport fishes (Shomura 1987; Honebrink 2000; Tagawa and Tam 2006). Twenty-seven species of carangids in 13 genera are listed as occurring in the Hawaiian Archipelago (Froese and Pauly 2010); of these, the jacks Caranx ignobilis Forsskål, 1775 and C. melampygus Cuvier, 1833 (called ulua aukea and omilu, respectively, by},

It is broadly considered that boreal fish populations living in colder habitats are determinate spawners whilst populations residing in warmer habitats tend to be indeterminate spawners. In the present study we modelled the determinate-indeterminate fecundity type in batch spawning fishes, i.e. fish that spawn several batches of eggs per spawning season, based on the relationship between oocyte growth period and the duration of the spawning period considering that both variables can be affected by water temperature and latitudinal distributions. Individual based models (IBMs) were developed to explore how the interaction of these variables can result in a series of patterns along the continuum from extreme determinacy, i.e. annual fecundity being recruited long before the onset of the spawning period, to indeterminacy. Model simulations showed that fish stocks with oocyte growth periods longer than the spawning period are predicted to exhibit determinate fecundity which provides a fair justification for why cold water species with slow oocyte growth and limited spawning periods are determinate spawners and vice versa.},

   abstract = {Female winter flounder were examined using gonad histology to determine the adequacy of routine macro-scopic maturity classification methods and to determine the spatial variation in size and age of maturity in U.S. waters. Sampling occurred in spring and autumn, which was adequate to collect immature, mature, spawning-active, and non-active females. Females were collected in coastal waters from Delaware Bay, USA, to the Scotian Shelf, Canada, including in Long Island Sound and on Georges Bank, which covered all U.S. stock areas. Mature fish spawned in spring, when gonads comprised up to 30% of the total body weight. Direct comparisons of maturity assignment by macroscopic versus microscopic methods demonstrated that both schemes are compatible, but the more cost-effective macroscopic method had trouble distinguishing larger immature from smaller resting females. Spatial comparisons, using gonad histology only, supported the existence of three stocks in U.S. waters, but also revealed significant variation in age at maturity within the two coastal stocks. Age-at-maturity was more variable than size-at-maturity, which is consistent with known stock-specific patterns of growth rates and a postulated life history tradeoff to delay maturity until a size threshold is reached. The within-stock variation in median age at maturity, about one year for coastal stocks, recommends further investigation of using static, stock-specific maturity ogives to calculate reference points for management.

   abstract = {Oogenesis in fishes follows a universal plan; yet, due to differences in the syn-chrony and rate of egg development, spawning frequency varies from daily to once in a lifetime. Some species spawn and feed in separate areas, during different seasons , by storing energy and drawing on it later for reproduction (i.e. capital breeding). Other species spawn using energy acquired locally, throughout a prolonged spawning season, allocating energy directly to reproduction (i.e. income breeding). Capital breeders tend to ovulate all at once and are more likely to be distributed at boreal latitudes. Income breeding allows small fish to overcome allometric constraints on egg production. Income breeders can recover more quickly when good-feeding conditions are re-established, which is a benefit to adults regarding bet-hedging spawning strategies. Many species exhibit mixed capital-and income-breeding patterns. An individual's position along this capital-income continuum may shift with ontogeny or in relation to environmental conditions, so breeding patterns are a conditional reproductive strategy. Poor-feeding environments can lead to delayed maturation, skipped spawning, fewer spawning events per season or fewer eggs produced per event. In a few cases, variations in feeding environments appear to affect recruitment variability. These flexible processes of energy acquisition and allocation allow females to prioritize their own condition over their propagules' condition at any given spawning opportunity, thereby investing energy cautiously to maximize lifetime reproductive value. These findings have implications for temporal and spatial sampling designs, for measurement and interpretation of fecundity, and for interpreting fishery and ecosystem assessments.},

There are also speculations that Greenland halibut are not capable of spawning every year. To investigate this possibility, ovaries from Greenland halibut caught throughout the year were examined histologically, and successive cohorts of oocytes were tracked through develop- ment. Results showed that the initial maturation of the ovaries from immature to spawning takes more than 1 year. The ovary initially develops as far as early vitellogenesis; however, the time scale for this is unclear. During the final year of development, the cohort of vitellogenic oocytes splits to form two cohorts; the larger cohort increases in size and is spawned in the coming spawning season. The smaller cohort also continues to develop, but at a much lower rate, in prepa- ration for development for spawning in the following year. Within each month, there is a large range of oocyte sizes be- tween fish; this leads to the extended spawning season that is known in many populations of this species. This complicates the assessment of maturity, and a more accurate microscopic maturity scale is proposed.},

   abstract = {Recreational fisheries can be prone to severe declines, yet these fisheries, particularly catch-and-release, are often data-limited, constraining our ability to conduct stock assessments. A combination of catch and effort indices derived from fisheries-dependent data (FDD) gathered from fishing logbooks could be a powerful approach to inform these data gaps. This study demonstrates the utility of using different catch metrics such as indices of abundance, species richness associated with reported catch, and the success rate of targeted trips, to assess historical shifts in the trajectory of the data-limited bonefish (Albula vulpes) fishery in Florida Bay, an economically-important recreational fishery within the Caribbean Basin. We used FDD from fishing guide reports submitted to Everglades National Park to determine temporal patterns in the bonefish population over the past 35 years. These reports indicated a decline in recreational catches in Florida Bay since the late 1980s, with an accelerated decline starting in the late 1990s-early 2000s. Analyses showed an overall 42% reduction in bonefish catches. Trends in the proportion of positive trips (i.e., the probability of catching success) followed the declining catch patterns, suggesting major population changes starting in 1999-2000. As bonefish catches declined, species richness in bonefish trips increased by 34%, suggesting a decrease in bonefish abundance and/or shift in fishing effort (e.g., giving-up time, changes in preferred species). Results provide additional resolution to a pattern of decline for bonefish in South Florida and highlight the value of reconstructing time-series for the development of hypotheses about the potential driving mechanisms of species decline. Further, the data-limited nature of most recreational fisheries, and the increase in a use of catch-and-release as a fisheries management strategy point to the need to develop further data integration tools to assess population trends and the sustainability of these fishery resources.

   abstract = {Seasonal and ontogenetic patterns in estuarine and coastal migrations of anadromous fish species have important consequences to their survival, growth, recruitment, and reproduction. We tested the hypothesis that otolith (sagitta) microchemistry can document the environmental history of individual fish across an estuarine salinity gradient. Juvenile striped bass, Morone suxntilis (Walbaum), (80 days posthatch) were reared for 3 wk in aquaria at two temperatures and six salinities. The ratio of strontium/calcium (Sr/Ca) deposited in the sagittal otoliths of reared juveniles was positively related to salinity. Temperature and growth rate had relatively minor, but significant effects on the Sr/Ca ratio. In a second experiment, juveniles (80 days posthatch) were exposed to increasing salinity (0 ppt to 25 ppt) and then decreasing salinity (25 ppt to 0 ppt) over a 20-wk period. Electron microprobe examination of the otoliths from these juveniles showed a gradual rise and decline in Sr/Ca during the experimental period which corresponded directly tiith experimental changes in salinity. Field data on subadult and adult striped bass corroborated the laboratory analyses and indicated a logistic relationship between ambient salinity and otolith Sr/Ca ratio. Verification studies support the use of otolith microchemistry to measure migratory schedules and habitat utilization patterns in anadromous striped bass populations.},

The techniques used to study these movements included LA-ICP-MS single line ablation transects and microchemical imaging as well as preliminary acoustic telemetry results which were used to aid in interpretation of chemical signatures related to complex movement patterns across salinity gradients. Ba:Ca and Sr:Ca from single ablation transects and microchemical images revealed differences between the otolith core and outer regions. Otolith Ba:Ca and Sr:Ca patterns were more easily distinguished in images compared to transects and these revealed that T. petardi spend their early life in saline waters. Movement patterns for adults varied, with a range of movements identified between fresh and saline waters. Telemetry data assisted in explaining the likely cause of the ambiguity in otolith microchemistry data, including identification of multiple rapid movements across salinity gradients. However, many movements through salin-ity gradients appear too brief to result in any clear Sr:Ca or Ba:Ca saline or mesohaline signature within the chemistry of the otolith. The combination of otolith chemistry and telemetry proved useful in providing information on this poorly understood species suggesting that T. petardi display a catadro-mous life history.},

   abstract = {Investigations into population structure have been at the forefront of fisheries research for decades, yet it is generally ignored in stock assessment models. As the complex nature of marine population structure has been uncovered, models have attempted to accurately portray it through the development of spatially explicit assessments that allow for movement between sub-populations. Although current tag-integrated movement models are highly complex, many arose from the relatively simple models of Beverton and Holt (1957). This article traces the historical development of these models and compares their features. Originally estimation of movement utilized only tag-recapture models, but now tag-integrated assessment models incorporate several sources of fishery, survey, and tag-recapture information to inform movement estimates. As spatial management measures become more widely used, it is increasingly important that assessment models include the spatial complexities of population structure and patterns of fishery removals, in order for more reliable monitoring of population rebuilding to take place. A generalized metapopulation model is proposed for use in fisheries stock assessment, which allows for adult movement among spatially discrete sub-populations. The input requirements for the model include region-specific catch-at-age, a tag-recapture dataset, and auxiliary information, such as a fishery-independent abundance index.},

   abstract = {The crevalle jack Caranx hippos, has a wide distribution in the Western Atlantic, becoming one of the most economically important species in the artisanal fishing industry in Colombia. However, little is known about its biology. The present study aimed to evaluate the variation and genetic structure of C. hippos in the Colombian Caribbean by analyzing the mitochondrial DNA region control and cytochrome oxidase subunit (COI). We sequenced the DNA of 153 muscle samples collected from specimens obtained from six fishing ports. The results showed 21 haplotypes for COI and 116 haplotypes for the control region, divided into two lineages that do not exhibit a pattern of geographical distribution. For mitochondrial control region, the estimated haplo-type diversity (Hd) presented relatively high values (Hd= 0.99 and = 0.1), while for COI results were Hd = 0.68 and = 0.01; the relationship between haplotype and nucleotide diversity and the neutrality test revealed that C. hippos experienced bottlenecking and a subsequent rapid population expansion. Estimates of genetic structure were low and insignificant, indicating no differentiation between samples collected from geographical isolation. This suggests that for the Colombian Caribbean there is a panmictic population of C. hippos. However, variations were found at population levels, especially in La Guajira, Turbo and San Antero, which, when compared to those included for Brazil and México, demonstrated that unique haplotypes in La Guajira are more aligned to the Brazilian populations, by means of the influence of the Caribbean Current, whilst those from Turbo and San Antero are more frequent in haplotypes originating from Mexico. Future studies should focus the understanding of these processes.},

Primarily, we used 26 key informants interviews to learn opinions of experts, and the grounded theory approach for further qualitative data analysis. In addition, we used Najman's (1995) policy implementation analysis framework to explain gaps. Many interrelated variables in the content of the policy, commitment and capacity of the agencies, the roles of clients and coalitions and contextual issues were observed. Variables that emerged suggest pitfalls in the regulatory policy represented by low probability of detection, arrest and punishment. Moreover, redistributive policies in buffer zones of protected areas are needed into perpetuity to benefit locals. Also, conservation organizations' support for building public and political salience is imperative.},

Marine Areas for Responsible Fishing (A ´ reas Marinas de Pesca Responsable, AMPR) have emerged as a new model for the co-management of small-scale fisheries in Costa Rica, one that involves collaboration between fishers, government agencies, and NGOs. The primary objective of this paper is to elucidate some of the key variables that influence collective action among small-scale fishers in Tárcoles, a community in the Gulf of Nicoya. We examined collective action for the formation of a local marketing cooperative and participation in management through the AMPR. We apply the social-ecological framework as a diagnostic and organizational tool in the analysis of several types of qualitative data, including interviews with key informants, informal interviews, legal documents, and gray literature. Findings illustrate the importance of socioeconomic community attributes (e.g., group size, homogeneity, previous cooperation), as well as that of social (e.g., equity) and ecological (e.g., improved stocks) outcomes perceived as favorable by actors. In addition, our work demonstrates the importance of certain kinds of external NGOs for facilitating and sustaining collective action.},

Here, we used LEK from key informants to obtain an in-depth understanding of angler and guide perspectives on the timing, placement and causes of bonefish decline, and effects on the fishery. Twenty in-depth interviews were conducted with the most-experienced anglers and fishing guides in South Florida (average 42 years of experience). Most respondents described a decline in the fishery that occurred over the 1990s (40% of respondents) and late 2000s (35%), with climate and water quality listed as top causes. Declines in number were larger than the declines in size, with Islamorada being one of the most impacted areas, and Biscayne Bay least impacted. Informants described declines in clientele targeting bonefish, shifts to other fisheries, and to locations outside South Florida. Responses emphasize the contribution of social science research methods, especially incorporating the cumulative knowledge of key stakeholders, to the understanding of ecological systems and their fisheries.},

   abstract = {Otolith microchemistry can provide valuable information about stock structure and mixing patterns when the magnitude of environmental differences among areas is greater than the cumulative influence of any vital effects. Here, the current understanding of the underlying mechanisms governing element incorporation into the otolith is reviewed. Hard and soft acid and base (HSAB) theory is employed to explore the differences in chemical behaviours, distributions and affinities between elements. Hard acid cations (e.g. Mg 2+ , Li + and Ba 2+) tend to be less physiologically influenced and accepted more readily into the otolith crystal lattice but are relatively homogeneous in seawater. Soft acid cations (e.g. Zn 2+ and Cu 2+) on the other hand, exhibit more varied distributions in seawater, but are more likely to be bound to blood proteins and less available for uptake into the otolith. The factors influencing the geographical distribution of elements in the sea, and their incorporation into the otoliths of marine fishes are reviewed. Particular emphasis is placed on examining physiological processes, including gonad development, on the uptake of elements commonly used in population studies, notably Sr. Finally, case studies are presented that either directly or indirectly compare population structuring or movements inferred by otolith elemental fingerprints with the patterns indicated by additional, alternative proxies. The main obstacle currently limiting the application of otolith elemental microchemistry to infer movements of marine fishes appears to lie in the largely homogeneous distribution of those elements most reliably measured in the otolith. Evolving technologies will improve the discriminatory power of otolith chemistry by allowing measurement of spatially explicit, low level elements; however, for the time being, the combination of otolith minor and trace element fingerprints with alternative proxies and stable isotopic ratios can greatly extend the scope of migration studies. Among the otolith elements that routinely occur above instrument detection limits, Ba, Mn and Li were deemed the most likely to prove reliable geographic markers in marine species.},

   abstract = {RATIONALE: Nitrogen and carbon stable isotope ratios (δ 15 N and δ 13 C values) of carbonate-bound organic materials in otoliths can provide information to address the biological and ecological functions of fish. Correct interpretation of otolith δ 15 N and δ 13 C profiles requires knowledge of the metabolic routes of nitrogen and carbon isotopes. However, the isotopic assimilation of δ 15 N and δ 13 C compositions from diets to otoliths has rarely been investigated. METHODS: This study traced the daily nitrogen and carbon isotopic assimilation between diets and otoliths using nanoscale secondary ion mass spectrometry (NanoSIMS). Isotopically labeled algae (Tetraselmis chui) were fed to tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus) for 14-17 days. NanoSIMS and conventional isotope ratio mass spectrometry were used to measure δ 15 N and δ 13 C variations in the otoliths and fish muscle, respectively. RESULTS: Otolith δ 15 N values abruptly surged from natural abundance levels by 1000-2300‰ after the fish ate 15 N-spiked algae with δ 15 N values of approximately 2200‰. However, the δ 15 N values of fish muscle increased to only approximately 500‰ at the end of the feeding experiment. Much higher δ 15 N values (3700-14 000‰) and moderate δ 13 C values (60-200‰) were detected in the otoliths after the tilapia ate 15 N-and 13 C-spiked algae with a δ 15 N value of 36667‰ and a δ 13 C value of 272‰. Mapping analysis showed sub-micrometer-scale distribution of 15 N embedded in the otolith growth increments with a low-to-high δ 15 N signal after the tilapia shifted diets from non-spiked to 15 N-labeled algae. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that otolith nitrogen and carbon isotopes from food were directly assimilated on the same day. Food is the major and in some cases only source of otolith nitrogen isotopes but makes only a partial contribution to otolith carbon isotopes. Therefore, the δ 15 N values recorded in the sclerochronological layers of the otoliths can be used to determine the trophic levels, food sources and diet changes of fish.},

   abstract = {This study extended a "data-limited" length-based stock assessment approach to a risk analysis context. The estimation-simulation method used length frequencies as the principal data in lieu of catch and effort. Key developments were to: (i) incorporate probabilistic mortality and growth dynamics into a numerical cohort model; (ii) employ a precautionary approach for setting sustainability reference points for fishing mortality (F REF) and stock reproductive biomass (B REF); (iii) define sustainability risks in terms of probability distributions; and, (iv) evaluate exploitation status in terms of expected length frequencies, the main "observable" population metric. This refined length-based approach was applied to six principal exploited reef fish species in the Florida Keys region, consisting of three groupers (black grouper, red grouper, and co-ney), two snappers (mutton snapper and yellowtail snapper), and one wrasse (hogfish). The estimated sustainability risks for coney were low (<35%) in terms of benchmarks for fishing mortality rate and stock reproductive biomass. The other five species had estimated sustainability risks of greater than 95% for both benchmarks. The data-limited risk analysis methodology allowed for a fairly comprehensive probabilistic evaluation of sustainability status from species and community perspectives, and also a frame of reference for exploring management options balancing sustainability risks and fishery production.},

   abstract = {Practicing ecologists who excel at their work (''experts'') hold a wealth of knowledge. This knowledge offers a wide range of opportunities for application in ecological research and natural resource decision-making. While experts are often consulted ad-hoc, their contributions are not widely acknowledged. These informal applications of expert knowledge lead to concerns about a lack of transparency and repeatability, causing distrust of this knowledge source in the scientific community. Here, we address these concerns with an exploration of the diversity of expert knowledge and of rigorous methods in its use. The effective use of expert knowledge hinges on an awareness of the spectrum of experts and their expertise, which varies by breadth of perspective and critical assessment. Also, experts express their knowledge in different forms depending on the degree of contextualization with other information. Careful matching of experts to application is therefore essential and has to go beyond a simple fitting of the expert to the knowledge domain. The standards for the collection and use of expert knowledge should be as rigorous as for empirical data. This involves knowing when it is appropriate to use expert knowledge and how to identify and select suitable experts. Further, it requires a careful plan for the collection, analysis and validation of the knowledge. The knowledge held by expert practitioners is too valuable to be ignored. But only when thorough methods are applied, can the application of expert knowledge be as valid as the use of empirical data. The responsibility for the effective and rigorous use of expert knowledge lies with the researchers.},

Fishers' knowledge research is an approach to fisheries research that has a relatively long history, yet has generally failed to become integrated into the fisheries science mainstream alongside approaches that rely primarily on the knowledge of professional scientists. Its continued position on the margins of fisheries science has not however stopped fishers' knowledge researchers from publishing an expanding literature, which they often use to advocate for the greater consideration of fishers' knowledge by fisheries scientists and managers. They believe that the unique and often highly qualitative knowledge of fishers could inform better decision-making, resulting in improved socio-ecological outcomes for fisheries. This review first outlines the scope of the fishers' knowledge literature, before outlining five waves of fishers' knowledge research that have developed over the last century. For each wave, the nature of the fishers' knowledge documented during it is noted, as is the research and dissemination approach taken by its practitioners. The impact of that wave on mainstream fisheries science is then assessed. Overall, it is found that only one wave of fishers' knowledge research is beginning to have consistent success integrating with mainstream fisheries science, a wave that omits the research of many of the unique elements of fishers' knowledge. Other waves have died out, or are in danger of dying out, either because they have failed to be noticed by mainstream fisheries scientists or because mainstream fisheries scientists have not welcomed their outputs. It is summarized that fishers' knowledge research will only continue as a productive activity if mainstream fisheries scientists begin to open their discipline to other knowledge cultures and if fishers' knowledge researchers facilitate this action by disseminating their research so that it is more accessible to these scientists.},

   abstract = {Understanding the nature of migratory behaviors within animal populations is critical to develop and refine conservation and management plans. However, tracking migratory marine animals across life stages and over multiple years is inherently difficult to achieve, especially for highly migratory species. In this paper, we explore the use of acoustic telemetry to characterize the spatial ecology of Atlantic tarpon (Megalops atlanticus), elucidate the ecology of this poorly studied species, and ultimately inform conservation and management. Using the data from twenty-two acoustically tagged Atlantic tarpon, we found a diversity of tarpon migratory patterns, including spatial and temporal overlap for some individuals. We also reveal fine scale movements within specific ecosystems, as well as a range of distributions and connectivity across coastal waters of the southeastern United States of America. For tarpon with tracking durations greater than one month (n = 13), we found heterogeneous space use and migratory connectivity with some tarpon remaining close to their capture location while others migrated hundreds of kilometers. In addition, we were able to identify a northern and southern limit for one migratory tarpon that had detections spanning over 365 days. We share analyses on Atlantic tarpon data, including model-driven approaches and network analysis, to investigate movement strategies and space use, which may be pertinent to other studies involving highly migratory species. The project was a collaborative effort involving several acoustic telemetry networks which enabled the monitoring of broad-and fine-scale movements for extended periods of time that would normally be difficult to achieve with other monitoring techniques. Although challenges exist with applying acoustic telemetry to monitor highly migratory species, we also discuss its value in enabling researchers to assess movements and space use beyond the focal species, such as cross-ecosystem comparisons and multi-species interactions.},

   abstract = {The fish otolith (earstone) has long been known as a timekeeper, but interest in its use as a metabolically inert environmental recorder has accelerated in recent years. In part due to technological advances, applications such as stock identification, determination of rnigralon pathways, reconstruction of temperature and salinity history, age validation, detection of anadromy, use as a natural tag and chemical mass marking have been developed, some of which are difficult or impossible to implement using alternative techniques. Microsamphg and the latest advances in beam-based probes allow many elemental assays to be coupled with daily or annual growth increments, thus providing a detailed chronologcal record of the environment. However, few workers have critically assessed the assumptions upon which the environmental reconstructions are based, or considered the possibility that elemental incorporation into the otolith may proceed differently than that into other calcified structures. This paper reviews current applications and their assumptions and suggests future directions. Particular attention is given to the premises that the elemental and isotopic composition of the otolith reflects that of the environment, and the effect of physiological filters on the resulting composition. The roles of temperature, elemental uptake into the fish and the process of otolith crystahzation are also assessed. Drawing upon recent advances i n geochemistry and paleoclirnate research as points of contrast, it appears that not all applications of otolith chemistry are firmly based, although others are destined to become powerful and perhaps routine tools for the mainstream fish biologst.},

   abstract = {Chemical constituents in otoliths have become a valuable tool for fish ecologists seeking to reconstruct migratory patterns and life-history diversity in a wide range of species worldwide. This approach has proved particularly effective with fishes that move across substantial salinity gradients over the course of their life, including many diadromous species. Freshwater endmembers of several elemental and isotope ratios (e.g. Sr:Ca, Ba:Ca and 87 Sr: 86 Sr) are typically identifiably distinct from marine values, and often differ among freshwater tributaries at fine spatial scales. Because these chemical tags are generally incorporated in proportion to their ambient dissolved concentrations, they can be effective proxies for quantifying the presence, duration and frequency of movements between freshwater and marine habitats. The development of high precision probe-based analytical techniques, such as laser ablation inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) and microbeam methods, has allowed researchers to glean increasingly detailed life-history profiles of these proxies across otoliths. Researchers are also combining multiple chemical proxies in an attempt to refine interpretations of habitat residence patterns. A thorough understanding of the spatial and temporal variation in water chemistry as well as environmental and physiological controls on incorporation of specific elements into otoliths is required for confident estimation of lifetime salinity experience. First some assumptions, methodological considerations and data processing options that are particularly relevant to diadromous otolith chemistry studies are discussed. Insights into diadro-mous migrations obtained from decades of otolith chemistry research, highlighting the increasingly recognized importance of contingent behaviour and partial migration are then discussed. Finally, areas for future research and the need to integrate otolith chemistry studies into comprehensive assessments of the effects of global environmental change are identified.},

Most S. trutta caught in rivers for otolith analysis were freshwater residents (95·6%), whereas those caught in the sea were mainly smolts (91·3%), which had just migrated from rivers during spring. Anadromous S. trutta (n = 6) were captured in rivers and in the sea, confirming the existence of mature pre-and post-spawning fish. According to telemetry results, both mature and immature S. trutta used the river in winter, and their estimated sea-run timings showed individual differences. Through the combination of these two methods, migratory patterns on various spatio-temporal scales were observed. This first documentation of the presence of both male and female anadromous S. trutta in the same region within Japan indicated the risk of further colonization of exotic S. trutta via oceanic migration.},

   abstract = {Otolith microchemistry and isotopic analyses have emerged as effective techniques for providing insights into fish environmental history that are difficult to obtain by other means. Stable hydrogen isotope ratio (2 H/ 1 H or D/H, expressed as δD) is a possible environmental marker that has not been employed in fish provenance research, although it has been applied as a natural tracer of terrestrial organism migrations. We illustrate the potential of δD to serve as a new natural marker of fish environmental history by demonstrating that significant linear relationships (r 2 ≥ 0.97) exist between fish otolith and muscle δD and δD of waters that fish inhabit. Differences between mean water δD and both muscle and otolith δD were not significantly correlated with fish total length and were not significantly different among species, indicating that water-fish δD relationships are consistent across fish sizes and species. High r 2 values for regressions of otolith and muscle δD on water δD for fishes inhabiting locations with diverse thermal regimes suggest that relationships between water and fish δD are not strongly affected by water temperature. Demonstration that fish δD clearly reflects water δD provides a foundation for future research to reconstruct fish movement among locations with distinct δD signatures. Résumé : La microchimie des otolithes et les analyses isotopiques se sont avérées être des techniques efficaces pour obtenir des rétrospectives de l'histoire environnementale des poissons qu'il serait difficile d'avoir autrement. Le rapport des isotopes stables d'hydrogène (2 H/ 1 H ou D/H, exprimé comme δD) est un marqueur environnemental potentiel qui n'a pas été utilisé dans les études sur l'origine des poissons, alors qu'il a été employé comme traceur naturel des migrations d'organismes terrestres. Nous illustrons le potentiel de δD comme nouveau traceur naturel de l'histoire environnementale des poissons en démontrant qu'il existe des relations linéaires significatives (r 2 ≥ 0,97) entre les δD des otolithes et des muscles et le δD des eaux fréquentées par les poissons. Les différences entre le δD moyen de l'eau et les δD des otolithes et des muscles ne sont pas en corrélation significative avec la longueur totale des poissons et ne différent pas significativement en fonction des espèces, ce qui indique que les relations δD eau-poissons sont unifor-mes, quelles que soit la taille ou l'espèce de poisson. Les fortes valeurs de r 2 des régressions des δD des otolithes et des muscles sur les δD de l'eau chez des poissons qui vivent dans des régimes thermiques différents laisse croire que les relations entre les δD de l'eau et des poissons ne sont pas fortement affectées par la température de l'eau. La démonstration que les δD des poissons reflètent clairement le δD de l'eau fournit une base pour les travaux futurs afin de récapituler les déplacements des poissons dans des sites possédant des signatures de δD différentes.

   abstract = {Otolith microchemistry can provide valuable information about stock structure and mixing patterns when the magnitude of environmental differences among areas is greater than the cumulative influence of any vital effects. Here, the current understanding of the underlying mechanisms governing element incorporation into the otolith is reviewed. Hard and soft acid and base (HSAB) theory is employed to explore the differences in chemical behaviours, distributions and affinities between elements. Hard acid cations (e.g. Mg 2+ , Li + and Ba 2+) tend to be less physiologically influenced and accepted more readily into the otolith crystal lattice but are relatively homogeneous in seawater. Soft acid cations (e.g. Zn 2+ and Cu 2+) on the other hand, exhibit more varied distributions in seawater, but are more likely to be bound to blood proteins and less available for uptake into the otolith. The factors influencing the geographical distribution of elements in the sea, and their incorporation into the otoliths of marine fishes are reviewed. Particular emphasis is placed on examining physiological processes, including gonad development, on the uptake of elements commonly used in population studies, notably Sr. Finally, case studies are presented that either directly or indirectly compare population structuring or movements inferred by otolith elemental fingerprints with the patterns indicated by additional, alternative proxies. The main obstacle currently limiting the application of otolith elemental microchemistry to infer movements of marine fishes appears to lie in the largely homogeneous distribution of those elements most reliably measured in the otolith. Evolving technologies will improve the discriminatory power of otolith chemistry by allowing measurement of spatially explicit, low level elements; however, for the time being, the combination of otolith minor and trace element fingerprints with alternative proxies and stable isotopic ratios can greatly extend the scope of migration studies. Among the otolith elements that routinely occur above instrument detection limits, Ba, Mn and Li were deemed the most likely to prove reliable geographic markers in marine species.},

   abstract = {Otolith chemistry is often useful for tracking provenance of fishes, as well as examining migration histories. Whereas elements such as strontium and barium correlate well with salinity and temperature, experiments that examine manganese uptake as a function of these parameters have found no such correlation. Instead, dissolved manganese is available as a redox product, and as such, is indicative of low-oxygen conditions. Here we present evidence for that mechanism in a range of habitats from marine to freshwater, across species, and also present ancillary proxies that support the mechanism as well. For example, iodine is redox-sensitive and varies inversely with Mn; and sulfur stable isotope ratios provide evidence of anoxic sulfate reduction in some circumstances. Further, S may be incorporated trophically whereas other elements appear to be taken up directly from water. This research suggests a potential means to identify individual fish exposure to hypoxia, over entire lifetimes. With further testing and understanding, in the future fish may be able to be used as "mobile monitors" of hypoxic conditions.},

   abstract = {Isotopic ratios of fish otoliths have been used in numerous studies as natural tags or markers to aid in the study of connectivity among fish populations. We investigated the use of spatial and temporal changes in the stable carbon and oxygen isotope ratios of otoliths to differentiate juvenile habitats of winter flounder (Pseudopleuronectes americanus). Young-of-the-year (YOY) juvenile winter flounder were collected annually over a three-year period from 18 stations along the coast of Rhode Island, USA. Sagittal otoliths were removed from fish and analyzed for stable carbon (13 C/ 12 C or δ 13 C) and oxygen (18 O/ 16 O or δ 18 O) isotope ratios using continuous flow isotope ratio mass spectrometry. Differences in isotope ratios were observed among stations and along salinity gradients in the Narragansett Bay estuary and an estuarine river system (Narrow River). Overall, the isotope ratio patterns observed among stations were consistent over the three sampling years; however, differences were noted in isotope ratios and the magnitude of the isotope ratio gradients among years. Significant positive correlations were noted between salinity and δ 13 C for two of the three years. For each of the three years sampled there was a highly significant positive correlation (2002, r= 0.93, P<0.01; 2003, r=0.85, P<0.01; 2004, r=0.97, P < 0.01) between δ 18 O and the salinity of the collection site. Also, there was a significant negative correlation between the number of months of above average river flow and δ 18 O for the three sampling years (r=0.99, P<0.05). These findings suggest that yearly changes in the volume of freshwater inputs to these estuarine habitats may be related to the differences observed in otolith δ 18 O isotope ratios. Because of these year-to-year differences, sampling of each cohort may be necessary in order to use this isotopic technique for winter flounder connectivity studies.},

   abstract = {Microchemical analyses of fish otoliths have revolutionized fisheries science. Molecules deposited within otoliths may originate from ambient water and diet, with molecular concentrations being subject to subsequent physiological alteration after exposure. Analyses of otolith microstructure and incorporation of inorganic elements have led to major advances in stock assessment and fisheries ecology. However, the use of otoliths for microchemical analyses has drawbacks. Specifically, otolith removal from live specimens requires specimen sacrifice, which may be forbidden in the case of protected species. In addition, otoliths rarely contain sufficient concentrations of organic matter to allow reconstruction of food-web relationships via multiple stable isotopes, and otolith microstructure can be difficult to interpret in some species. Here, we review alternatives to otoliths that can provide microchemical analytes for life-history studies in fishes. Our focus is to describe advantages and disadvantages to the use of each alternative structure, with particular attention paid to trace-element analysis for inorganic matrices and stable-isotope analysis for organic ones. In general, the chronological analysis of elemental and isotopic values within each structure depends on the inert nature (or lack of molecular turnover) of the tissue. Structures with high turnover rates or those that are metabolically active will not effectively record elemental or isotopic compositions over time. Here, we provide an assessment of the use of bony endoskeleton, fin spines, fin rays, scales, and eye lenses as alternatives or complements to fish otolith analysis.},

   abstract = {We evaluated eye lenses as potential recorders of stable isotope histories in fish because they consist of metabolically inert optical proteins that are deposited in successive, concentric circles (laminae) much like otolith circuli and tree rings. We conducted four different tests on lenses from red snapper, red grouper, gag, and white grunt. The first test was a low-resolution screening of multiple individuals (4-5 radial groups of laminae per lens, all species except white grunt). Along the radial axis, all individuals exhibited substantial isotopic variability. Red snapper individuals separated into two groups based on d 15 N and gag separated into two groups based on d 13 C. Two gag with the greatest variation were chosen for high-resolution temporal analysis using individual laminae from their second eye lenses. The first-order patterns from the high-resolution analysis generally mimicked patterns from the low-resolution screening of grouped laminae, yet the high-resolution plots revealed early-life details that were not apparent in the low-resolution screenings. For the third test, left-versus right-eye variation was compared using high-resolution methods. White grunt left-and right-eye radial isotopic patterns were almost identical for both d 13 C and d 15 N, suggesting the variations observed among individual fish were not artifacts. The final test evaluated intra-laminar variation; multiple samples were analyzed from different parts of the same lamina. Seven laminae from three individuals of two species were analyzed in this manner; variations among laminae were found to be much higher than variations within laminae. However, nominal intra-laminar variations were comparable to nominal differences between left and right lenses, suggesting intra-laminar variation established measurement precision. Eye lens isotopes appear to be useful for reconstructing the isotopic histories of individual fish; these histories can be compared with spatially-derived isoscapes to reconstruct individual histories for site fidelity, movement and trophic position.},

   abstract = {Multiple regression models were created to explain spatial and temporal variation in the δ 13 C and δ 15 N values of fish populations on the West Florida Shelf (eastern Gulf of Mexico, USA). Extensive trawl surveys from three time periods were used to acquire muscle samples from seven groundfish species. Isotopic variation (δ 13 C var and δ 15 N var) was calculated as the deviation from the isotopic mean of each fish species. Static spatial data and dynamic water quality parameters were used to create models predicting δ 13 C var and δ 15 N var in three fish species that were caught in the summers of 2009 and 2010. Additional data sets were then used to determine the accuracy of the models for predicting isotopic variation (1) in a different time period (fall 2010) and (2) among four entirely different fish species that were collected during summer 2009. The δ 15 N var model was relatively stable and could be applied to different time periods and species with similar accuracy (mean absolute errors 0.31-0.33‰). The δ 13 C var model had a lower predictive capability and mean absolute errors ranged from 0.42 to 0.48‰. δ 15 N trends are likely linked to gradients in nitrogen fixation and Mississippi River influence on the West Florida Shelf, while δ 13 C trends may be linked to changes in algal species, photosynthetic fractionation, and abundance of benthic vs. planktonic basal resources. These models of isotopic variability may be useful for future stable isotope investigations of trophic level, basal resource use, and animal migration on the West Florida Shelf.},

Muscle δ 15 N from three widely distributed fish species, Synodus foetens (inshore lizardfish), Calamus proridens (littlehead porgy), and Syacium papillosum (dusky flounder), exhibited strong longitudinal correlations (Pearson′s r¼ À0.67 to À 0.90, po 0.001) that coincided with the principal trophic gradient, whereas δ 13 C values of fish muscle and benthic algae were correlated with depth (Pearson′s r¼ À0.34 to À 0.73, p o0.05). Correlations between isotopic values and surface concentrations of chlorophyll and particulate organic carbon (POC) imply linkages between the isotopic baseline and transitions from eutrophic to oligotrophic waters.

   abstract = {A growing number of examples indicate that large predators can alter seagrass ecosystem structure and processes via top-down trophic interactions. However, the nature and strength of those interactions varies with biogeo-graphic context, emphasizing the need for region-specific investigations. We investigated spatial and temporal variation in predatory fish and seagrass communities across a Marine Protected Area (MPA) boundary in the Banana River Lagoon, Florida (USA), assessing trophic roles of intermediate consumers, and performing a large-consumer exclusion experiment in the MPA. Large, predatory fishes were most abundant within the MPA, while some mid-sized fishes were more abundant outside it. Small, seagrass-resident fishes, epifaunal invertebrates, and macrophytes also differed across the MPA boundary, but varied more among individual sites and seasonally. We cannot conclusively attribute these patterns to MPA status because we lack data from prior to MPA establishment and lack study replication at the level of MPA. Nevertheless, other patterns among our data are consistent with hypothesized mechanisms of top-down control. E.g., inverse seasonal patterns in the abundance of organisms at adjacent trophic levels, coupled with stable C and N isotope and gut contents data, suggest top-down control of crustacean grazers by seasonal recruitment of small fishes. Large-consumer exclosures in the MPA increased the abundance of mid-sized predatory and omnivorous fishes, but had few impacts on lower trophic levels. Results suggest that large-scale variation in large, predatory fish abundance in this system does not strongly affect seagrass-resident fish, invertebrate, and algal communities, which appear to be driven more by habitat structure and seasonal variation in small fish abundance.},

Specifically, we provide an overview of the ways in which acoustic telemetry can be used to inform issues central to the ecology, conservation, and management of exploited and/or imperiled fish species. Despite great strides in this area in recent years, there are comparatively few examples where data have been applied directly to influence fisheries management and policy. We review the literature on this issue, identify the strengths and weaknesses of work done to date, and highlight knowledge gaps and difficulties in applying empirical fish telemetry studies to fisheries policy and practice. We then highlight the key areas of management and policy addressed, as well as the challenges that needed to be overcome to do this. We conclude with a set of recommendations about how researchers can, in consultation with stock assessment scientists and managers, formulate tes-table scientific questions to address and design future studies to generate data that can be used in a meaningful way by fisheries management and conservation practitioners. We also urge the involvement of relevant stakeholders (managers, fishers, conservation societies, etc.) early on in the process (i.e., in the co-creation of research projects), so that all priority questions and issues can be addressed effectively.},

   abstract = {Stable carbon isotope ratios (δ 13 C) were measured in annual layers of otoliths of Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua) from the northeastern Scotian Shelf, Atlantic Canada. Layers deposited during the first 4-6 years of otolith growth increased in δ 13 C from minimum values between-5‰ and-2.5‰ to a maximum near 0‰. This pattern of increase was independent of the years in which the fish was collected. Layers formed after reaching the maximum δ 13 C value displayed decreasing or nearly constant isotopic ratios. Early rise in δ 13 C may be a combined result of (i) decrease in the fraction of metabolic oxidized carbon in the fishes' blood as they mature, relative to the proportion of seawater-derived carbon, and (ii) dietary shift to higher trophic-level foods with higher δ 13 C values. Age of maximum in δ 13 C may be indicative of age of maturity of cod. The maximum δ 13 C value attained by otoliths decreased steadily between 1983 and 1993, while cod stocks in Atlantic Canada were declining. Drop in age of attainment of maximum δ 13 C between 1984 and 1985 coincides with changes in population dynamics of the 4Vs stock. This decrease, as well as the post maximum decrease in δ 13 C values of the mature cod otoliths may represent movement of the fish to deeper waters of the shelf, where δ 13 C of dissolved inorganic carbon is lower. Résumé : Nous avons déterminé le rapport des isotopes stables du carbone (δ 13 C) présents dans les anneaux de croissance annuels des otolithes de morues (Gadus morhua) provenant du nord-est de la plate-forme Néo-Écossaise, dans la région canadienne de l'Atlantique. Dans les anneaux correspondant aux 4-6 premières années de la formation des otolithes, le rapport δ 13 C a augmenté, passant d'une valeur minimum comprise entre-5 ‰ et-2,5 ‰ à une valeur maximum proche de 0 ‰. Le mode d'augmentation était indépendant de l'année où les poissons ont été capturés. Dans les anneaux formés après celui où le rapport δ 13 C avait atteint sa valeur maximale, le rapport des isotopes diminuait ou demeurait presque constant. L'augmentation du rapport δ 13 C observée au cours des premières années pourrait être due à l'effet conjugué des facteurs suivants : (i) durant la maturation du poisson, la concentration sanguine de carbone métabolique oxydé baisse par rapport à la concentration de carbone provenant de l'eau de mer; et (ii) le poisson change d'alimentation et sa nourriture provient d'un niveau trophique supérieur présentant un rapport δ 13 C plus élevé. L'âge où le rapport δ 13 C est maximum pourrait être celui où la morue parvient à maturité. Nous avons constaté que la valeur maximum du rapport δ 13 C dans les otolithes a diminué suivant une courbe régulière de 1983 à 1993, période durant laquelle les stocks de morue ont baissé dans l'Atlantique canadien. L'âge où le rapport δ 13 C atteignait sa valeur maximum a baissé de 1984 à 1985; cette baisse coïncide avec les changements de la dynamique des populations observés dans les stocks de la zone 4Vs. Il se peut que ce phénomène, de même que la diminution du rapport δ 13 C observée après la pointe de valeurs maximums dans les otolithes des poissons matures, corresponde au déplacement de la morue vers les eaux plus profondes de la plate-forme, où le rapport δ 13 C des formes de carbone inorganique dissous est moins élevé.

Here we report 18 analyses of such otoliths on seasonal (winter and summer) stable oxygen and carbon isotope ratios. The calculated isotopic temperatures from otoliths of reared cod were essentially in agreement with the temperature record during rearing, suggesting that temperature is a dominant factor in the precipitation of otolith aragonite. Carbon isotope ratios increased with age and leveled off at 4 years old, presumed to correlate with sexual maturity of cod. As compared with otoliths of wild-caught cod, significant differences were found in isotope variation and the correlation between δ 13 C and δ 18 O. These differences were probably attributable to the different environmental constraints and food supply.},

   abstract = {Rationale: Stable oxygen isotope ratios (δ 18 O values) measured in fish otoliths can provide valuable detailed information on fish life history, fish age determination, and ocean thermography. Traditionally, otoliths are sampled by micromilling followed by isotope ratio mass spectrometry (IRMS), but direct analysis by secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS) is becoming more common. However, these two methods have not been compared to determine which, if either, is better for fish age validation studies. Hence, the goals were to: (1) determine if the δ 18 O signatures from the two different methods are similar, (2) determine which method is better for fish age validation studies, and (3) examine biogeographic and migration history. Methods: Both analytical techniques, micromilling/IRMS and SIMS, were used to measure δ 18 O values in six Pacific cod (Gadus macrocephalus) otoliths. A series of measurements was made from the center of each otolith to its edge to develop a life-history δ 18 O signature for each fish. Results: The sampling resolution of SIMS analyses was 2-3 times greater than that obtained by micromilling/IRMS. We found an offset between SIMS and micromilling/IRMS δ 18 O values, about 0.5‰ on average, with SIMS yielding lower values. However, the δ 18 O patterns from both methods (i.e., the number of δ 18 O maxima) correspond to the estimated age determined by otolith growth-zone counts, validating fish age determination methods. Conclusions: Both techniques resolved δ 18 O life-history signatures and showed patterns consistent with seasonal variation in temperatures and changes due to fish migration. When otoliths are large, micromilling/IRMS can provide adequate resolution for fish age validation. However, SIMS is the better option if greater sampling resolution is required, such as when otoliths are small or specimens are longer lived and have compact growth zones.},

The extent to which this is influenced by structural rather than cellular electric remodeling is unclear.Objective:To determine whether structural remodeling alone in the infarct BZ could provide a substrate for re-entry by (i) characterizing the 3-dimensional (3D) structure of the myocardium surrounding a healed MI at high spatial resolution and (ii) modeling electric activation on this structure.Methods and Results:An anterior left ventricular (LV) infarct was induced in a rat by coronary artery ligation. A 3D BZ volume (2.99×2.68×0.70 mm(3)) was imaged at 14 days using confocal microscopy. Viable myocytes were identified, and their connectivity and orientation were quantified throughout the volume. Preserved cell networks were observed in the subendocardium and subepicardium of the infarct. Myocyte tracts traversed the BZ, and there was heavy infiltration of collagen into the adjacent myocardium. Myocyte connectivity decreased by ≈F65 over 250 μm across the BZ. This structure was incorporated into a 3D network model on which activation was simulated using Luo-Rudy membrane dynamics assuming normal cellular electric properties. Repetitive stimulation was imposed at selected BZ sites. Activation times (21-35 ms) were prolonged because of tract path length and local slowing. Stimulus-site-specific unidirectional propagation occurred in the BZ with rate-dependent slowing and conduction block, and reentry was demonstrated in this substrate.Conclusions:We have used a detailed image-based model of the infarct BZ to demonstrate that structural heterogeneity provides a dynamic substrate for electric reentry.},

   abstract = {The Pacific cod (Gadus macrocephalus) fishery in Alaska is large and economically important; in 2014 its ex-vessel value was $203.8 million. Management relies on integrated assessments that employ survey abundance trends and fishery catches as well as age compositions from assessment surveys. However, Pacific cod age determination based on otolith growth zone counts has historically been difficult, adding to the uncertainty in biological reference points. Further, a mismatch exists where modes in fish length frequencies are larger than mean lengths at otolith-based age. To address ageing inaccuracy, we conducted an age validation study using stable oxygen isotopes (18 O). This approach is based upon the principle that variability in marine carbonate 18 O is inversely related to water temperature, which we independently verified in Pacific cod otoliths (r 2 = 0.74). We sequentially microsampled 40 Pacific cod otoliths from the core to the margin and measured the aragonite 18 O by isotope ratio mass spectrome-try. This provided a detailed 18 O life history chronology for each specimen. First, we identified seasonal variation (the cyclical pattern of otolith 18 O values) and determined whether the number of 18 O maxima , considered to represent "true fish age," was consistent with the age estimated from growth zone counts. Second, we estimated the probability of bias in the ages determined from growth zone counts. Overall, the probability of assigning an age (based on the number of counted growth zones) equal to the true age (number of 18 O maxima) was approximately 61%. However, the probabilities of over-or underestimating the age by 1 year were 25% and 13%, respectively. The probability of over-or underestimating true age by 2 or more years was very low (<2%). The probability of age misclassification was used to correct bias in mean length at age. Published by Elsevier B.V.},

   abstract = {We measured δ 18 O values in modern and archaeological Pacific cod (Gadus macrocephalus) otoliths recovered from Aialik Bay on the Pacific coast of the Kenai Peninsula, Alaska, using a high precision ion microprobe. Values of δ 18 O were measured in as many as sixty 10-μm spots along 2-3 mm transects from the otolith core to its margin with high spot-to-spot analytical precision (δ 18 O ± 0.3‰). We obtained sample densities along a linear transect that were at least 2 to 3 times greater than micromilling/conventional mass spectrometry techniques. From modern Pacific cod otoliths (using in situ temperatures from electronic archive tags) we calibrated an empirical fractionation equation of aragonite δ 18 O to sea water temperature (r 2 = 0.75, p < 0.001, δ 18 O A = 2.13-0.25 T °C) and from which we predicted the thermography of fish life history and historic near-shore water temperature in the Gulf of Alaska (GOA). Sinuous variability of δ 18 O values along core-to-margin transects likely reflect seasonal temperature changes and suggest similar longevity between modern and archaeological cod. Generally increasing δ 18 O values from the otolith core region to the margin revealed an on-togenetic migration from warmer nearshore habitat during the first year of life to cooler deeper waters at later ages, a behavior that has not changed over the past 200 years. A decline in the average δ 18 O of otolith cores from archaeological (~ 200 +, ~100 + years before present, YBP) to modern otoliths suggest increasing sea surface temperatures from the late Little Ice Age to present. Temperatures calculated from the δ 18 O in aragonite suggest a 2-3 °C rise in coastal marine sea surface temperatures in the GOA over the last 200 years. Implications of indigenous subsistence resource use and settlement patterns are discussed in light of major shifts in GOA water temperatures and biological regimes.},

Evaluation of 18 O and 13 C values of mature halibut (ages 8-12) indicated that the 1977 regime shift might have a warming impact on the northeast Pacific fish stocks. In contrast, a possible regime shift around 1990 with a bottom seawater temperature decrease of about 2 • C might have occurred in both the areas. The connection between stable isotope variations in otoliths and the climate regime shifts is thus potentially useful in studying the population dynamics of Pacific halibut, and decadal scale (e.g., the last 20-30 years) ocean environmental changes.},

   abstract = {Assessing connectivity is fundamental to understanding the population dynamics of fishes. I propose that isotopic analyses can greatly contribute to studies of connectivity in estuarine fishes due to the high diversity of isotopic signatures found among estuarine habitats and the fact that variations in isotopic composition at the base of a food web are reflected in the tissues of consumers. Isotopic analysis can be used for identifying nursery habitats and estimating their contribution to adult populations. If movement to a new habitat is accompanied by a shift to foods of distinct isotopic composition, recent immigrants and residents can be distinguished based on their isotopic ratios. Movement patterns thus can be reconstructed based on information obtained from individuals. A key consideration is the rate of isotopic turnover, which determines the length of time that an immigrant to a given habitat will be distinguishable from a longtime resident. A literature survey indicated that few studies have measured turnover rates in fishes and that these have focused on larvae and juveniles. These studies reveal that biomass gain is the primary process driving turnover rates, while metabolic turnover is either minimal or undetectable. Using a simple dilution model and biomass-specific growth rates, I estimated that young fishes with fast growth rates will reflect the isotopic composition of a new diet within days or weeks. Older or slower-growing individuals may take years or never fully equilibrate. Future studies should evaluate the factors that influence turnover rates in fishes during various stages of the life cycle and in different tissues, as well as explore the potential for combining stable isotope and otolith microstructure analyses to examine the relationship between demographic parameters, movement and connectivity.},

Little is known about the migration corridors that exist between nursery and coral reefs, or the timing of these migrations. This study investigated the possibility of identifying connections between juvenile nursery areas and nearby coral reef adult habitats using stable isotope analysis of the otoliths of gray snapper (Lutjanus griseus) (n = 71) and yellowtail snapper (Ocyurus chrysurus) (n = 60), collected from 10 sites along the Florida Keys coral reef tract in 2003. Measurements of carbon and oxygen isotope ratios were compared to existing isotopic signatures of juvenile snapper from nursery areas around southern Florida. Data showed overlap for 13 C and 18 O isotope measurements for the juvenile portion of sub-adult otoliths to isotope values for the middle and lower Florida Keys regions, thereby suggesting a migratory connection. Specific nursery habitats contributed approximately 93 % of individuals sampled for yellowtail and approximately 98 % for gray snapper to the Florida Keys coral reef tract. Results from this study indicate locally important source regions and habitats for the successful recruitment of fish to the Florida Keys coral reef tract. Published by Elsevier B.V.

Northern form Dolly Varden Char (Salvelinus malma malma) are closely linked to perennial groundwater sources during the freshwater stages of their life cycle. This close connectivity provides an ideal circumstance for stock discrimination using archived sagittal otoliths (1986-2007) collected from the river drainages of the study area (Firth River, Yukon Territory (YT), Babbage River, YT, Big Fish River, Northwest Territories (NT), Rat River, NT, and Vittrekwa River, NT). Laser ablation-ICP-MS techniques were employed to measure 87 Sr/ 86 Sr isotopes and trace elements (Sr, Ba, S, Zn, Mg, P) from dorso-ventral otolith thin sections. Random forest model, learning algorithm and tree classification provided 94.4% classification success for individual fish to the river systems (putative stocks). Misclassifications within the model occurred among the Vittrekwa, Bab-bage, and Rat river drainages. Strontium, 87 Sr/ 86 Sr ratio and Ba were the most significant discriminators within the model, although removal of the remaining elements reduced overall discriminatory power. Microchemical analyses of archived otoliths provided high classification and discrimination success thus can be used as a tool for fisheries managers in developing effective management and conservation plans regarding mixed-stock fisheries for this species.},

   abstract = {Australian salmon, Arripis trutta, collected from the east coast of Tasmania, Australia, in 1987, were weighed and measured and their otoliths marked by immersing fish in an oxytetracycline hydrochloride/seawa-ter solution before placement in constant-temperature aquaria. Individual somatic and otolith growth rates were determined for input into mass balance models. Mass balance models were used to determine the oxygen and carbon isotopic composition of otolith material produced during captivity. There was a significant relationship between filsO measured in the otolith aragonite and ambient temperature (r 2 = 0.77). The linear relationship between these data, where 6180 = 6.69-0.326 (T, °C), was not significantly different from a relationship indicative of equilibrium deposition of oxygen isotopes in aragonite. Otolith carbon was significantly depleted in 13C relative to equilibrium deposition, with depletions > 6.0%o at all temperatures. There was no relationship between 6~3C and temperature. It was estimated that > 30% of the otolith carbon was from metabolically derived sources. Significant differences in otolith carbon isotopes among wild juvenile Australian salmon were hy-pothesised to be attributable to differences in diet. Levels of variability for both oxygen and carbon isotopes in laboratory-maintained and wild fish were similar to that found by other researchers for foraminifera and these results highlight the importance of large sample sizes when estimating environmental temperatures from oxygen isotopes measured in fish otoliths.},

The isotope signatures for fish from the different locations persisted through time, and it could be concluded that they comprised separate stocks for most of the purposes of fisheries management. Values for ratios of stable oxygen isotopes in pilchard otolith carbonate indicated that they were probably deposited close to equil~brium and therefore reflected ambient water temperatures as governed by latitude and movements of the Leeuwin Current. This suggested that the measurement of ratios of stable oxygen isotopes can be a valuable method for the discnm~nation of management u n ~ t s of adult fish where the range of distnbu-tion of a species covers waters of different temperatures.},

Recent research has aimed to make LEK more quantitative-a key step to better integration of LEK into fisheries science and management. Here, we used LEK to a) quantify changes in bonefishing quality over time in South Florida as perceived by members of the flats fishery, and b) demonstrate the applicability of a life history calendar approach to LEK quantitative data collection. In an online survey, we asked anglers and guides to quantitatively evaluate changes in the quality of bonefishing, as a function of bonefish number and size, over the past 40 years in Biscayne Bay, Florida Bay, and the Florida Keys. Results showed a perceived 56% decrease in bonefish number, and a 45% decline in bonefish size since 1975. Respondents reported a decline in bonefish numbers that preceded the decline in size, with numbers starting to decline over 1985-1995, and size by 2005. In terms of the pattern of decline, bonefish number showed a heterogeneous pattern, with a slower rate of decline in 1985-2005 and an accelerated rate over 2005-2010, whereas the size decline was homogenous over 2000-2015. Overall, the study provides additional resolution, spatial coverage, and support to the pattern of bonefish population decline in the region, illustrating the utility of quantitative approaches to LEK data collection , and highlighting the value of integrating multiple knowledge sources to fully characterize ecological patterns.},

The decreasing number of soft-shell turtle and reticulated python in the wild is due to high demand of the animal in local as well as international market. The condition made the Indonesian government set particular collecting and trading quota for the reptiles, but unfortunately, it does not automatically guarantee their preservation. Current collecting practices will lead to population decline and even extinction of the species since the reptilesâ€™ population in the wild has not yet been accurately determined. The purpose of the research was to determine a rapid method of population estimation to establish a baseline for determining collecting quota for the reptiles, especially of softshell turtles and reticulated pythons. The study was conducted in East Kalimantan using the method of deep interviews of 20 respondents (exporters, fishers, traders, collectors) and 15 key respondents (government officials). The results of this survey showed that the collect reptiles were collected from the wild, since up to now, there has been no successful breeding program of reptiles. The collected reptiles were dominated by female adult softshell turtles collected from Kotabangun area which has collecting quota of 1,080/year (1/3 of the exporting quota for East Kalimantan). Softshell turtles collected from Kotabangun have bigger in stature than those found in West Java and Jakarta, and the reticulated pythons collected from Kotabangun are longer than those found in West Java and Jakarta. The number of reticulated pythons collected from Kotabangun reaches 4,800 individuals/year (1/4 of the quota set for East Kalimantan export).</p>},

   abstract = {The effects of surgical staples on incision healing and long-term fish growth are largely unknown. To determine these effects, we implanted 50 rainbow trout Oncorhynchus mykiss with dummy radio transmitters , closed incisions with either silk sutures or steel staples, and monitored these fish for 6 months. Surgeries with staples were performed twice as fast as suture surgeries. Incisions closed with staples had three times less epidermal infection than sutured incisions. Fish with staples lost significantly fewer visible implant tags and had a lower incidence of abdominal bloating, two signs of systemic stress, than did fish with sutures. Six months after surgery, treatment and control groups had grown equally. The lower incidence of local and systemic infection caused by staples and the faster speed with which they can be applied suggest stapling is a better method than suturing for closing incisions. Silk sutures and steel staples (hereafter sutures and staples, respectively) are two materials used to close surgical incisions made in fish to insert radio transmitters (Summerfelt and Smith 1990; Winter 1996). Effects of the two materials, and the different surgical methods used, on long-term wound healing and fish growth have not been quantitatively compared. The ideal closing material is quick to apply, sterile, and secure. Sutures are used more commonly than staples (Ross and Kleiner 1982; Summerfelt and Smith 1990; Knights and Lasee 1996). However, sutures are relatively slow to apply and may be insecure if tied improperly, and the surgeon needs substantial practice before applying them. Mortality associated with surgeries using sutures can exceed 45% (Mulford 1984). Mulford (1984) and Mortensen * Corresponding author: dschmett@bigsky.net.},

   abstract = {Adaptive management (AM) and evidence-based conservation (EBC) have emerged as major decision-making frameworks for conservation management. AM deals with complexity and the importance of local context in making conservation decisions under conditions of high variability, uncertainty, and rapid environmental and social change. EBC seeks for generality from empirical data and aims to develop and enhance best practice. The goal of this review is to explore opportunities for finding common ground between AM and EBC. We propose a framework for distinguishing the subset of conservation problems that are amenable to an evidence-based approach, based on levels of uncertainty , complexity, and social agreement. We then suggest ways for combining multiple lines of evidence and developing greater opportunities for iteration and co-learning in EBC. The Debate over Adaptive Management versus Evidence-Based Conservation Adaptive management (AM) is a key approach to conservation implementation in conditions of high variability, uncertainty, complexity, and rapid environmental and social change. In such situations, AM, which involves a cycle of problem definition, planning, implementation, monitoring , evaluation, knowledge-sharing, and adaptation, allows practitioners, planners, and researchers to learn by doing. AM involves identifying the conservation problem, defining management objectives, then exploring options for management interventions that are thought to result in these objectives. Once implemented, management interventions are monitored, and the results are used to redefine management objectives and/or refine future management options. The process is iterative and multiple cycles are needed so that management can respond to emerging knowledge, changing environmental conditions, or shifts in stakeholder preferences. AM has many advantages in terms of its focus on learning and its ability to accommodate the complexity and plurality, which is a feature of most conservation problems. Various forms of AM have evolved that are suited to different local contexts and policy environments. For example, in South Africa, strategic adaptive management (SAM) emerged from the need to develop new conservation goals based on a nonequilibrium ecological paradigm and in situations of high social complexity (Box 1). However, critics of AM argue that the AM process is too cumbersome and a method is needed that allows conservation decisions to be made rapidly and efficiently, based on prior experience. Evidence-based conservation (EBC) aims to provide a pragmatic alternative, where conservation managers can efficiently share information on the outcome of management interventions, contributing to a shareable database that can be freely accessed by all. Highlights Adaptive management (AM) and evidence based conservation (EBC) have emerged as leading approaches to conservation management. AM allows for exploration of complexity under conditions of high uncertainty, while EBC allows managers to pool experience of the outcomes of conservation intervention in order to decide on 'best practice'. We explore a framework for defining the subset of conservation problems to which EBC could be applied, using certainty and agreement as guiding principles. We develop a modified adaptive management cycle that includes an evidence base alongside iterative learning feedbacks. We consider tools and methods that allow the integration of multiple types of evidence alongside empirical scientific data and explore the possibilities for databases that are capable of learning.},

   abstract = {The Pacific cod (Gadus macrocephalus) fishery in Alaska is large and economically important; in 2014 its ex-vessel value was $203.8 million. Management relies on integrated assessments that employ survey abundance trends and fishery catches as well as age compositions from assessment surveys. However, Pacific cod age determination based on otolith growth zone counts has historically been difficult, adding to the uncertainty in biological reference points. Further, a mismatch exists where modes in fish length frequencies are larger than mean lengths at otolith-based age. To address ageing inaccuracy, we conducted an age validation study using stable oxygen isotopes (18 O). This approach is based upon the principle that variability in marine carbonate 18 O is inversely related to water temperature, which we independently verified in Pacific cod otoliths (r 2 = 0.74). We sequentially microsampled 40 Pacific cod otoliths from the core to the margin and measured the aragonite 18 O by isotope ratio mass spectrome-try. This provided a detailed 18 O life history chronology for each specimen. First, we identified seasonal variation (the cyclical pattern of otolith 18 O values) and determined whether the number of 18 O maxima , considered to represent "true fish age," was consistent with the age estimated from growth zone counts. Second, we estimated the probability of bias in the ages determined from growth zone counts. Overall, the probability of assigning an age (based on the number of counted growth zones) equal to the true age (number of 18 O maxima) was approximately 61%. However, the probabilities of over-or underestimating the age by 1 year were 25% and 13%, respectively. The probability of over-or underestimating true age by 2 or more years was very low (<2%). The probability of age misclassification was used to correct bias in mean length at age. Published by Elsevier B.V.},

   abstract = {The otolith of a crevalle jack fish (caranx hippos) has been investigated by means of X-ray diffraction, X-ray absorption fine structure spectroscopy and scanning electron microscopy techniques. The results suggest that the biomineral-ization of otolith occurs predominantly in the aragonite phase. A detailed X-ray Rietveld analysis showed that the first shell Ca-O distances in otolith lay in the range 2.371-2.652 A ˚ , with each calcium atom coordinated to 9 oxygen atoms. While the average Ca-O distance remains same in both otolith and aragonite, certain Ca-O distances in otolith differ markedly from those in aragonite. Such difference reflects the remarkable degree of control that the protein matrix exercised over packing of calcium and carbonate ions to promote growth of rarer aragonite otolith. In view of the complex coordination chemistry of calcium in otoliths, the EXAFS analysis was limited to obtaining local atomic environment about calcium up to the first Ca-O shell. EXAFS data showed an asymmetric distribution of Ca-O bond distances with the centroid of distribution at 2.48 A ˚ , which is closer to the average Ca-O distance in aragonite than in calcite. The asymmetry in the Ca-O peak is consistent with an apparent departure of Ca-O distances from a near regular distribution , as expected of an aragonite otolith.},

Objectives were to describe the distribution of carangid larvae and to examine distribution patterns relative to areas of higher zooplankton volumes in order to reveal areas that may be important nurseries. Samples contained about 29,200 carangid larvae from 13 species or species complexes in 11 genera. Chloros-combrus chrysurusand Decapterus punctatus accounted for 91.7% of all larvae. We found that the 'scads' (D.punctatus, Trachurus lathami, and Selar crumenoph-thalmus) utilize temporally and/or spatially distinct spawning strategies to reduce co-occurrence of larvae. Samples contained fewer larvae than expected of the amberjacks (Seriola spp.), Caranx crysos, and C. hippos/ latus given the abundance of adults in the survey area, possibly due to inadequate sampling at appropriate times and locations, gear avoidance, or gear bias. Zoo-plankton displacement volumes (ZDVs) differed among regions and seasons and were inversely related to surface salinity and station depth. Differences among years were not significant. ZDVs were consistently highest near the Mississippi River delta and along the western Louisiana/ eastern Texas shelf, and moderately high during summer and fall along the shelf break, with localized pockets of elevated volumes over the eastern Gulf shelf. We suggest that Chloroscombrus chrysurus,D. punctatus, T. lathami, and possibly Oligoplites saurus, Hemicaranx am-blyrhynchus and Caranx crysos spawn in frontal areas and/or along other hydrographic features that promote higher productivity. We provide new illustrations and descriptive information for the larvae of H. amblyrhyn-chus and discuss characters that separate early larvae of several species of Caranx.},

A cada individuo se le midió longitud total, el peso total y el peso gonadal. La fecundidad se estimó combinando el método gravimétrico con análisis de imágenes, usando el software de libre acceso Image J ®. A partir de la medición de 149523 ovocitos se obtuvo un diámetro promedio de 0.32 ± 1.24E-4 mm, y valores de fecundidad variables con un ámbito entre 291439 y 4380480 ovocitos/gónada. No se evidenció una relación directa entre la cantidad y el diámetro de los huevos con la talla y el peso del pez, lo que sugiere que no siempre las hembras más grandes son las más fecundas.

Caranx hippos is one of the most important fish resources in Colombia, particularly in artisanal fisheries. In order to deepen C. hippos biological knowledge, fecundity (number of eggs in development) and oocyte diameter was estimated. Fish samples were collected from commercial artisanal fishing trips, each fish was measured (total length, Lt) and weighted (total weight, Pt); gonads were removed, weighed and analyzed for determining fecundity using a gravimetric method combined with image analysis performed using the open access software Image J®. From the measurement of 149552 oocytes, an average diameter of 0.32 ± 1.24E-4 mm, was obtained, while fecundity varied between 291439 and 4380480 oocytes per gonad.

   abstract = {Neoclassical economics has only recently considered the problem of sustainability-how to provide for the well-being of future generations given ecological constraints. In general, the neoclassical economist perceives physical and ecological constraints on economy-environment interactions as inconveniences that will inevitably be overcome by substitution-the discovery of new economic resources or technologies allowing the conversion of noneconomic materials to economic goods. Ecologists and ecological economists, however, argue that the constraints will bind. The debate centres on the relevance of entropy to the economics of resource use: irrelevant in the neoclassical view, relevant in the ecological. This paper places entropy, within the context of neoclassical economic thought, as a limit to economic growth. The paper rigorously argues the existence of limits to knowledge and consequently to technology and substitution, undermining a basic assumption of neoclassical economics and establishing the relevance of entropy to economic theories of resource use.

   abstract = {A study was performed to test the hypothesis that Atlantic cod Gadus morhua captured within fjords do not migrate across the sill into outer fjord segments or coastal waters. An 18 month long telemetry experiment, corroborated by recapture patterns, showed that 40% of the tagged fish crossed the sill. The majority of the fish that crossed the sill, however, returned after short excursions of only a few days. Many fish remained stationary at or near the release location, and migrations up the fjord into brackish water appeared more frequent than migration out of the fjord. The stable isotope analyses showed significant differences between the inner and the outer fjord segments, and this was seen for both adults and juveniles. This suggests that the Atlantic cod in the two areas have different diets and probably utilize different foraging ranges. Thus, both the isotope studies and the telemetry experiment suggest limited cross-sill migration and rather high site fidelity. Marketing restrictions only apply to fish caught in the fjord proper, not the comparatively clean outer fjord system beyond the sill. Based on this study of migratory tendencies, it is concluded that contamination levels in Atlantic cod in both the Frierfjord proper and the outer fjords probably result from local exposure and appear little affected by inter-fjord migration.},

   abstract = {Istiophorid billfishes are highly migratory species that inhabit the tropical and subtropical, epipelagic waters of the world's oceans, a large, relatively homogeneous environment that lacks significant physical barriers. Based on these observations alone, one would not expect marlins, sailfish and spearfishes to exhibit substantial stock structure. This assumption has been evaluated with a variety of techniques, including analyses of morphological characters, adult distribution, tag and recapture data, the spatial and temporal distribution of spawning and, recently, molecular genetic characters. This paper focuses on inferences of istiophorid billfish stock structure derived from investigation of several different classes of molecular markers, and reviews our current understanding of the genetic basis of stock structure of striped marlin, white marlin, blue marlin, sailfish and black marlin. Significant genetic differences exist between Atlantic and Indo-Pacific populations of blue marlin and sailfish, and the presence of distinct mitochondrial DNA lineages suggests that ocean populations were isolated in the past. However, the occurrence of identical genotypes in both oceans is evidence of recent genetic contact. The genetic data do not support recognition of separate Atlantic and Indo-Pacific species of blue marlin or sailfish. White and striped marlin are separated by about the same level of genetic divergence as Atlantic and Indo-Pacific populations of blue marlin and sailfish, but preliminary analysis of the mitochondrial DNA control region suggests that, unlike Atlantic and Indo-Pacific populations of blue marlin and sailfish, white marlin and striped marlin represent independent evolutionary units. If white and striped marlin are valid species, they are of very recent origin. Significant intraspecific genetic heterogeneity was found among collections of striped marlin and sailfish within the Indo-Pacific; both species exhibited a clear spatial partitioning of genetic variation among geographically distant collection locations. There was no genetic evidence for within-ocean population structuring for other istiophorids examined. Inferences of billfish stock structure derived from studies of molecular markers complement those obtained using other methods of analysis, and together these studies demonstrate substantial differences in the level of population structuring among istiophorid billfishes, information critical for effective management of these highly migratory species.},

The mean F ST estimate over all loci was 0.0080. Overall, the cod populations surveyed conformed to an isolation-by-distance structure, cod from more distant locations tending to be more genetically distinct. Among offshore sites, the Flemish Cap population (NAFO Division 3M) was the most distinctive, and among inshore sites, the Gilbert Bay population in southern Labrador (2J) was the most distinctive. In NAFO Divisions 3KL, no significant genetic differentiation was observed among inshore northern cod sampled in four bays (Notre Dame, Bonavista, Trinity, and Conception) along the northeast coast of Newfoundland, and the data do not support the hypothesis of separate ''bay stocks''. Annual variation within sampling sites was as large, on average, as the differentiation among sampling sites. The inshore northern cod were distinct from the population in Gilbert Bay and from most offshore northern cod populations. On average, over all populations, regional differences in allele frequencies were seven times larger than annual variation. The offshore samples were more heterogeneous, and there may be at least three distinct offshore spawning populations of northern cod. In Subdivision 3Ps, no consistent differentiation was observed among sampling sites, two in inshore bays (Placentia, Fortune), and two offshore (Burgeo Bank, Halibut Channel). The southern Grand Bank (Divisions 3NO) may have a separate spawning population from those in other offshore sites, but additional sampling is required to confirm population distinctiveness. Crown},

Increased commer-cialization, population growth, promotion of fisheries development projects, and the live reef food fish trade are expected to increase demand for the country's reef fish. This paper examines how socioeconomic factors affect the condition of the artisanal multi-species coral reef fishery in six sites in Papua New Guinea. Catch characteristics such as diversity, trophic level and body size by landing site were examined along a fishing pressure gradient. Both exogenous factors such as markets and endogenous factors such as fishing pressure were related to the condition of fish catch. In general, the trophic level and lengths of fish captured in Papua New Guinea were relatively high, but were reduced on reefs with high fishing effort near fish markets. Fisheries showed signs of depletion above c. 25 fishing trips per km 2 per day and the proximity of markets was a better indicator of overfishing than human population size. A cross-scale approach to fisheries management is required in Papua New Guinea to coordinate decentralized local management, limit the intrusion of extractive enterprises, and develop policies that seek to minimize exogenous pressures on marine resources.},

To try and combat this trend, researchers have drawn upon the knowledge of local resource users as an important supplement to scientific knowledge in designing and implementing management strategies. The integration of local knowledge with scientific knowledge for marine species management, however, is problematic stemming primarily from conflicting data types. This paper considers the use of spatial information technology as a medium to integrate and visualise spatial distributions of both quantitative scientific data and qualitative local knowledge for the purposes of producing valid and locally relevant fisheries management plans. In this context, the paper presents a detailed protocol for the collection and subsequent use of local knowledge in fisheries management planning using geographic information systems (GIS). Particular attention is paid to the use of local knowledge in resource management, accuracy issues associated with the incorporation of qualitative data into a quantitative environment, base map selection and construction, and map bias or errors associated with the accuracy of recording harvest locations on paper map sheets, given the complications of map scale.},

Rehage Abstract The widespread use of electronic tags allows us to ask new questions regarding how and why animal movements vary across ecosystems. Common Snook (Centropomus undecimalis) is a tropical estuarine sportfish that have been well studied throughout the state of Florida, including multiple acoustic telemetry studies. Here, we ask; do the spawning behaviors of Common Snook vary across two Florida coastal rivers that differ considerably along a gradient of anthropogenic change? We tracked Common Snook migrations toward and away from spawning sites using acoustic telemetry in the Shark River (U.S.), and compared those migrations with results from a previously published Common Snook tracking study in the Caloosahatchee River. We found that the proportions of fish that did not migrate out of rivers during the spawning season and presumably skip spawned were similar between the two systems. However, in the Shark River, there was more year-to-year variability in this behavior, likely tied to freshwater flow and floodplain inundation. Second, we found that the length of time individuals spent outside of rivers during the spawning season (i.e. proxy for time spent spawning) was less in the Shark River than in the Caloosahatchee. Last, the proportion of Snook at emigrated and did not return in the Shark River was higher than in the Caloosahatchee. These latter finding could reflect higher straying rates or higher mortality at spawning grounds. Future work should evaluate whether these spatial differences in river migrations are meaningful enough to affect management. This study illustrates that cross-site comparisons can improve confidence in our understanding of life history metrics while also highlighting differences between sites that are worth exploring to gain a better understanding of a species plasticity in adapting to their environment.},

   abstract = {Memory is critical to understanding animal movement but has proven challenging to study. Advances in animal tracking technology, theoretical movement models and cognitive sciences have facilitated research in each of these fields, but also created a need for synthetic examination of the linkages between memory and animal movement. Here, we draw together research from several disciplines to understand the relationship between animal memory and movement processes. First, we frame the problem in terms of the characteristics , costs and benefits of memory as outlined in psychology and neuroscience. Next, we provide an overview of the theories and conceptual frameworks that have emerged from behavioural ecology and animal cognition. Third, we turn to movement ecology and summarise recent, rapid developments in the types and quantities of available movement data, and in the statistical measures applicable to such data. Fourth, we discuss the advantages and interrelationships of diverse modelling approaches that have been used to explore the memory-movement interface. Finally, we outline key research challenges for the memory and movement communities, focusing on data needs and mathematical and computational challenges. We conclude with a roadmap for future work in this area, outlining axes along which focused research should yield rapid progress.},

   abstract = {Gray snapper (Lutjanus griseus) encounter a wide range of temperatures and salinities in nearshore and estuarine juvenile habitats. The energetic response of juvenile gray snapper to temperature and salinity was measured in laboratory experiments to determine the influence of these physicochemical factors on the potential value of different juvenile nurseries. Maximum consumption and growth rates of juvenile (25-50 mm SL) gray snapper were determined in 12-day trials at 20 temperature/salinity combinations representing conditions in juvenile habitats. Ad libitum feeding level of individual fish was measured daily. Maximum weight specific feeding rate increased significantly with temperature and salinity; however, the effect of salinity was much less than that of temperature. Linear growth rate and specific growth rate both increased with temperature, and salinity did not have a significant effect on either. Gross growth efficiency (K 1 , growthÂconsumption À1 *100) increased with temperature and was significantly lower at high salinities, indicating increased energetic costs. The higher K 1 at lower salinities has several implications for juvenile gray snapper in low salinity habitats: (1) they would need less food to achieve the same somatic growth as juveniles in high salinity habitats; (2) they would have higher growth at limited ration levels as compared to high salinity habitats; and (3) they would have less impact on prey populations than higher salinity habitats assuming similar gray snapper densities.},

   abstract = {In the present work, eight forecasting techniques are evaluated on the basis of their efficiency to model and provide accurate operational forecasts of the annual commercial landings of 16 species or groups of species in the Hellenic (Greek) marine waters. The development of operational forecasts was based on the following four general categories of forecasting techniques: (a) deterministic simple or multiple regression models incorporating different exogenous variables (time-varying regression, TV; multiple regression models incorporating time, fishing effort, wholesale value of catch and climatic variables, MREG) ; (b) univariate time series models (Brown's one parameter exponential smoothing, BES; Holt's two parameter exponential smoothing, HES; and AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA)); (c) multivariate time series techniques (harmonic regression, HREG; dynamic regression, DREG; and vector autoregressions, VAR); and (d) the 'biological' exponential surplus-yield model, FOX. Fits (for 1964-1987) and forecasts (for 1988-1989) obtained by the different models were compared with each other and with those of a naive method (NM) and an empirical one (i.e. combination of forecasts, EMP) using 32 different measures of accuracy. The results revealed that HREG and MREG models outperformed, in terms of fitting accuracy, the remaining eight models (NM, TV, BES, HES, FOX, ARIMA, VAR and EMP). They were both characterised by: (a) higher accuracy in terms of all, or most, standard and relative statistical measures; (b) unbiased fits; (c) much better performance than NM; (d) transformed errors which were essentially white noise. In addition, HRJZG and MREG models: (e) explained from 79% to 97% of the variability of 13 transformed annual catches and from 31% to 61% for the remaining ones; (f) produced fits with MAPE values ranging from 3.4% to 21.2%; (g) in all, or most cases, predicted the between year variations during the fitting period, 1964-1987. In terms of forecasting performance, however, not a single best approach was found for the 16 annual catches. In general, BES and, to a lesser extent, HES, NM (which actually is an ARIMA (0,l ,0)), EMP and HREG models were among the best performers more often, produced the worst forecasts more rarely and were generally char-acterised by the higher number of stable forecasts and of forecasts with MAPE < 20% and < 10%. TV was also efficient for some annual series. Conversely, the poorest performers (FOX, MREG and ARIMA) rarely did better than average. The biological FOX models produced the least accurate and biased fits, bad forecasts (> 34.1%) in two out of four cases, and were characterised by transformed errors that were significantly (P<O.O5) autocorrelated. Some of the empirical models also had interesting explanations. Hence, the univariate ARIMA and multivariate VAR time series models predicted persistence of catches. The multivariate VAR and HREG time series models also predicted cycles in the variability of the catches with periods of 2-3 years. Moreover, FOX and MREG models indicated that fishing effort, wholesale value of catch and climate may, in a synergetic fashion, affect long-term trends and short-term variation in the catches of, at least, some species (or groups of species). Finally, MREG and VAR models predicted that variability and replacement of anchovy by sardine catches are not due to chance, and wind activity over the northern Aegean Sea may act as a forcing function.},

In the field of fisheries research, management regulations have long demanded population abundance estimates even if data available are sparse, leading to the development of a range of fish stock assessment methods designed for data-poor populations. Here, we present methods developed within the context of fisheries research that can be applied to conduct population abundance estimations when facing data-limitations. We begin the review from the less data-demanding approaches and continue with more data-intensive ones. We discuss the advantages and caveats of these approaches, the challenges and management implications associated with data-poor stock assessments, and we propose the implementation of the Bayesian hierarchical framework as the most promising avenue for future development and improvement of the current practices.

   abstract = {Fishing reduces stock size and shifts demographics, and selective mortality may also lead to evolutionary changes. Previous studies suggest that traits may change evolutionarily because of fishing on decadal time scales. Here we examine the potential bioeconomic impacts of fishing-induced evolutionary change. We used a life-history model with stock dynamics based on evolving maturation age, which has consequences for size-at-age, coupled with a fishing module that describes costs and economic yield. Size-dependent natural mortality and trawl-like fishing mortality are drivers of selection, and in the analysis we varied fishing mortality and size-selectivity of the fishing gear to determine trait evolution as well as economic yield. Comparison of two scenarios-allowing for evolution and assuming no evolution-shows that under current size selectivity, the fishing regimes generating maximum economic yield are not different when evolution is accounted for. However, ignoring evolution overestimates long-term yield under optimal fishing regimes and underestimates resilience to overfishing. Whether fishing-induced evolution matters for management strategies depends on size selectivity, stock state, how it acts on specific traits, and its sensitivity to the assumed discount rate, calling for a cautious use of net present value as sole criterion for management of evolving resources. Résumé : La pêche réduit la taille des stocks et produit des changements au sein des populations, et la mortalité sélective pourrait également mener a ` des changements évolutionnaires. Des études antérieures donnent a ` penser que des caractères pourraient évoluer en raison de la pêche a ` l'échelle décennale. Nous examinons les possibles impacts bioéconomiques des changements évolutifs induits par la pêche. Nous avons utilisé un modèle de cycle biologique intégrant la dynamique des stocks basé sur l'évolution de l'âge a ` la maturation, ce qui a des conséquences pour la taille selon l'âge, jumelé a ` un module de pêche qui décrit les coûts et le rendement économique. La mortalité naturelle selon la taille et la mortalité par pêche de type chalut sont des moteurs de sélection et, dans notre analyse, nous avons modulé la mortalité par pêche et la sélectivité selon la taille des engins afin de déterminer l'évolution des caractères, ainsi que le rendement économique. La comparaison de deux scénarios, un qui permet l'évolution et l'autre non, montre que, dans les conditions actuelles de sélectivité selon la taille, les régimes de pêche qui engendrent le rendement économique maximum ne diffèrent pas selon que l'évolution est prise ou non en considération. Cela dit, la non prise en considération de l'évolution se traduit par la surestimation du rendement a ` long terme dans des régimes de pêche optimaux et sous-estime la résilience a ` la surpêche. L'importance de l'évolution induite par la pêche pour les stratégies de gestion dépend de la sélectivité selon la taille, de l'état des stocks et de son effet sur des caractères précis et elle est sensible au taux d'actualisation présumé, ce qui nécessite une certaine prudence dans l'utilisation de la valeur actualisée nette comme seul critère pour la gestion de ressources en évolution.

In addition, many species constitute important resources for fisheries and tourism activities, with some included in lists of endangered species. In this socio-ecological context, data from fish assemblages has frequently subsidized the creation and/or management of Marine Protected Areas (MPAs). With the purpose of providing a baseline assessment of reef fish to subsidize the management of Pedra da Risca do Meio Marine State Park (whose acronym in Portuguese is PEMPRM), we describe the composition and assemblages structure of the fishes in this MPA. To inventory the species, we conducted 112 SCUBA dives with the intensive search method at eight sites inside the PEMPRM during six years of sampling. In parallel, to assess the structure of the assemblages, we conducted 63 stationary visual censuses distributed among three of these sites during one year of sampling. In total, 131 taxa belonging to 54 families were identified representing approximately half of the regional diversity. Thirteen of these species (10%) are included in categories with some level of threat IUCN or Brazilian red list categories and six are considered endemic to the Brazilian Biogeographic Province. The assemblages of the three studied sites varied in species richness, number of endangered species, and trophic structure. These results were corroborated by multivariate analyzes (PERMANOVA) that indicated significant differences among the assemblages of the three sites. Our results point to a spatial zoning approach for the management of PEMPRM.</p></div>},

Abundances and trophic assemblage of sharks at Ashmore Reef in 2004 resembled those of the Scott Reefs, where targeted fishing for sharks still occurs, whereas in 2016, abundances and trophic structures had recovered to resemble those of the Rowley Shoals, a reef system that has been a strictly enforced MPA for over 25 years. The shift in abundance and community structure coincident with strict enforcement of the MPA at Ashmore Reef has occurred at a rate greater than predicted by demographic models, implying the action of compensatory processes in recovery. Our study shows that shark communities can recover rapidly after exploitation in a well-managed no-take MPA.},

Here, we quantified three components, namely, diversity, biomass, and other relevant variables, in numerous protected and unprotected areas across four marine ecoregions in south-western Europe. We created a "global conservation status index" (CSI<sub>global</sub>) as the sum of CSI<sub>diversity</sub>, CSI<sub>biomass</sub>, and CSI<sub>relevant</sub>. We then tested whether CSI and its three components varied as a function of protection and marine ecoregion. MPA efficiency, defined as the effect size of protection on CSI<sub>global</sub>, was unreliable and varied with geography. CSI<sub>biomass</sub> and CSI<sub>relevant</sub> contributed to the unreliability of MPA efficiency, while CSI<sub>diversity</sub> was reliable. CSI<sub>biomass</sub> showed the major efficiency in protected areas (60%). Biomass of threatened species was the single largest variable that contributed to MPA efficiency. Our easy-to-use approach can identify high- and low-efficient MPAs and help to clarify their actual roles.</p>},

   abstract = {There have been efforts around the globe to track individuals of many marine species and assess their movements and distribution, with the putative goal of supporting their conservation and management. Determining whether, and how, tracking data have been successfully applied to address real-world conservation issues is, however, difficult. Here, we compile a broad range of case studies from diverse marine taxa to show how tracking data have helped inform conservation policy and management, including reductions in fisheries bycatch and vessel strikes, and the design and administration of marine protected areas and important habitats. Using these examples, we highlight pathways through which the past and future investment in collecting animal tracking data might be better used to achieve tangible conservation benefits. Tracking Data and Conservation Policy The advent of reliable technology to track individual animals long-term (often >1 year), throughout marine and terrestrial environments, has produced a golden era for animal tracking studies [1,2]. In marine systems, long-term tracking is now routine for fish (e.g., bony fish, sharks, rays), birds (e.g., penguins, albatrosses, and shearwaters), mammals (e.g., seals, sirenians, dolphins, and whales), and reptiles (e.g., sea turtles). One driver behind growth in marine animal tracking studies is the need for distribution and movement data to inform conservation policy and management. In a recent literature review of 13 349 'movement ecology' papers published between 1990 and 2014, 35% (n = 4672 papers) mentioned 'conservation' [3]. However, the value of tracking data to inform policy is often presented as a 'given', yet not explicitly demonstrated [4]. For example, a review of the conservation impact of sea turtle tracking studies highlighted that of 369 papers published between 1982 and 2014 (supported by a questionnaire-based survey of 171 sea turtle researchers), there were only 12 instances where tracking findings led to clearly identifiable real-world changes in conservation practice, even though >120 papers identified conservation as a rationale for the work [5]. This suggests that either tracking and distribution data are not considered to be relevant or barriers exist which prevent their uptake by policy makers and managers, to the Highlights The value of animal tracking data to inform policy is illustrated by case studies from around the world and with a broad range of taxa. Application of tracking data to policy and management can take various pathways, and engagement with sta-keholders might often not be made by the original data collectors. The impact of tracking data on policy and management can be improved if data collection and analyses target specific needs for management outcomes. Early engagement among the data collectors and the stakeholders involved in policy development and implementation is important to help translate tracking data into conservation outcomes.},

   abstract = {The quality of the coral reefs in the Florida Keys is essential to sustain nature-based tourism in the Keys. The recently established marine reserves (MR) are expected to improve the reef environment, particularly coral and fish abundance and diversity. In this paper, a combined model of travel cost and contingent behavior was estimated in order to measure the non-market recreational benefits of reef quality improvements. The results indicated that an average visitor would undertake 43-80% more number of trips to the Florida Keys and experience a 69% increase in the use values per trip, as a result of the MR-induced reef quality improvements. The above non-market value estimates were further applied to evaluating alternative management proposals for funding the MR program. It was found that the annual management costs of the MR program would constitute an insignificant portion-only around one to 2%-of the annual recreational benefits that the MR would generate. The results provide a strong economic justification for designing user-based funding mechanisms in order to make the MR program self-sustaining in the future. © 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

   abstract = {Ecologists who specialize in translational ecology (TE) seek to link ecological knowledge to decision making by integrating ecological science with the full complement of social dimensions that underlie today's complex environmental issues. TE is motivated by a search for outcomes that directly serve the needs of natural resource managers and decision makers. This objective distinguishes it from both basic and applied ecological research and, as a practice, it deliberately extends research beyond theory or opportunistic applications. TE is uniquely positioned to address complex issues through interdisciplinary team approaches and integrated scientist-practitioner partnerships. The creativity and context-specific knowledge of resource managers, practitioners, and decision makers inform and enrich the scientific process and help shape use-driven, actionable science. Moreover, addressing research questions that arise from on-the-ground management issues-as opposed to the top-down or expert-oriented perspectives of traditional science-can foster the high levels of trust and commitment that are critical for long-term, sustained engagement between partners. A s humans continue to drive 21st-century global environmental change, ecologists are striving to meet the challenges of social and environmental sustainability. For ecology to inform environmental policy formulation and management, new partnerships between ecologists and users of ecological research must be developed. To be effective, these partnerships require a collective commitment to applying scientific knowledge to specific decisions that aim to solve complex environmental problems today and into the future. In this Special Issue of Frontiers in Ecology and the Environment, we present a framework for crafting and applying translational ecology (TE) that builds on ideas first proposed by Schlesinger (2010) and those recently articulated by Brunson and Baker (2015). The collection of papers in this Special Issue explore the many facets of the idea that "just as physicians use translational medicine to connect the patient to new basic research, TE should connect end-users of environmental science to the field research carried out by scientists who study the basis of environmental problems" (Schlesinger 2010). In this introductory paper, we define TE, distinguish it from applied ecology and other areas, and explain its unique role at the nexus where knowledge meets action. This is the realm of TE-situated at the intersection of a broad spectrum of institutions and information pathways, where scientists, practitioners, and stakeholders (Panel 1) work together to develop ideas and products that are accessible, actionable, and shaped by all participating parties (Figure 1). We establish foundational principles for TE, describe the mechanisms by which it can increase the effectiveness of ecological science in the context of environmental decision making, and then introduce the suite of papers in this issue, and explain how they address the challenges and opportunities associated with this evolving practice.

We summarize some of the major roles of boundary spanners in translational ecology, and suggest that effectiveness in translating ecological information depends on several key factors. These include organizational and individual commitment to boundary spanning over the long term; development of useful, co-produced products and tools that can subsequently assume boundary-spanning roles of their own; dual-accountability frameworks that involve both science providers and users; and identification, training, and retention of science translators who possess a suite of professional skills and individual traits that are rare in scientific circles.},

   abstract = {The economic value of rare, threatened and endangered species to citizens of the USA has been measured using the contingent valuation method for 18 different species. Annual willingness to pay (WTP) range from a low of $6 per household for fish such as the striped shiner to a high of $95 per household for the northern spotted owl and its old growth habitat. A regression analysis of WTP values shows that over half of the variation in WTP is explained by the change in the size of the population, whether the payment is one-time or annual, whether the respondent is a visitor or non-user and whether the species is a marine mammal or bird. This illustrates that the contingent valuation method can provide meaningful estimates of the anthropocentric benefits of preserving rare and endangered species, Thus, economic techniques are available to perform broad-based benefit-cost analyses of species preservation. However, the Safe Minimum Standard approach is offered as an alternative for endangered species preservation decisions. The values reported in this paper are most useful to assess whether the costs are likely to be disproportionate to the benefits. To date, for even the most expensive endangered species preservation effort (e.g., the northern spotted owl) the costs per household fall well below the benefits per household found in the literature.},

   abstract = {Background. There is a striking male predominance in esophageal cancer patients. Sex hormones have been suggested as a contributing factor and these are influenced by age and race. In this study, we examined the male-to-female incidence rate ratios of esophageal cancer in the United States. Methods. We used data from 13 registries in the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database to calculate male-to-female incidence rate ratios of esophageal adenocarcinoma (EA) and esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) diagnosed during 1992-2006 in different age and race groups. Results. For EA, all races had similar sex and age-specific incidence patterns showing a peak in the male-to-female incidence rate ratio in the age group 50-59, and an age-related decline thereafter. The highest male-to-female ratio was seen in Hispanics (20.5) and the lowest in Blacks (7.0) compared with 10.8 in Whites. By contrast, the male-to-female incidence rate ratios were low and fairly stable throughout the different age groups in ESCC. Conclusion. The male-to-female incidence rate ratios in esophageal cancer vary considerably according to histology, age, and race. The highest sex ratios were seen in EA in the age group 50-59, rendering plausibility to the hypothesis that female sex hormone exposure may play a protective role in the development of this cancer.},

This resource has been affected by pollution, sedimentation and overfishing. DNA barcoding was used for fish species identification, and the genetic diversity and population structure of two valued fish genera, snappers (Lutjanus spp.) and jacks (Caranx spp.) from the main fishing grounds in the area was evaluated. Fishermen collected tissue samples and measured size and weight and capture location for each fish. A 700 base pairs (bp) fragment of the mitochondrial Cytochrome Oxidase I (COI) was sequenced for 104 samples (55 snappers and 49 jacks). Comparisons against Genbank allowed identification of eight species: Lutjanus synagris, L. apodus, L. jocu, L. cyanopterus, L. analis, Caranx hippos, C. latus and C. crysos. Genetic diversity for the fish around the Colombian Caribbean sampling locations was relatively high in comparison to those of other populations and population differentiation was significant for some species, particularly for L. synagris and L. apodus, suggesting that the fish from the Colombian Caribbean belong to an independent stock. Mean body length for all species was significantly smaller than body length at maturity, indicating that all fish captured were immature. Levels of genetic diversity appear to be high in these fish populations. The fact that fishermen are capturing immature fish is worrisome, suggesting the need to improve management of fish populations and the need to include the communities in conservation planning for the Islas del Rosario National Natural Park.},

We propose an objective approach to subsetting trip records of catch and effort data when fishing locations are unknown; the species composition taken on a fishing trip is used to infer if that trip's fishing effort occurred in a habitat where the species of interest (the target species) is likely to occur. We use a logistic regression of multispecies presence-absence information to predict the probability that the target species would be present. A critical value of probability that best predicts target species presence and absence in the data set forms an objective basis for subsetting the trip records. We test this approach by applying it to a data set where individual fishing locations are known, and we show that the method is an effective substitute for information on individual fishing locations.},

HCRs, however, often require data-intensive stock assessments to facilitate the harvest prescription. An HCR based on catch and catch per unit effort (cpue) was developed for the southern and eastern scalefish and shark fishery of Australia, for stocks that lack the data needed to conduct a full statistical catch-at-age assessment. The HCR produces a recommended biological catch and is characterized by two parameters, target cpue and target catch, both derived from historical data. Simulation tests showed that the HCR could guide the stock to the desired state from different initial levels of depletion. However, the selection of parameter values for the HCR was critical. Achieving fishery objectives was difficult when the target catch was a function of recent catch, rather than data from a predefined historical reference period. Problems may also arise when specifying the reference period on which the HCR parameters are determined. The cpue-based HCR is a valuable tool for managing fisheries where monitoring and assessment activities are relatively expensive, or in general, where data are scarce},

   abstract = {Decisions regarding the selection and implementation of management strategies that constrain fishing pressure can be among the most difficult choices that fisheries managers and stakeholders must make. These types of decisions often need to be confronted in a data-limited context, where few if any management measures are currently in place or fisheries are managed independent of adequate scientific advice. This situation can sometimes create a high risk of overfishing and potential loss of economic and social benefits. To address this situation, simple model-free indicator-based frameworks have the potential to be effective decision-making platforms for fisheries where quantitative estimates of biomass and fishing mortality based reference points are lacking. In this paper, a multi-indicator framework is developed that enables decision-makers to proceed with management decisions in data-limited situations. Model-free indicators are calculated using trends in observed data, rather than stock assessment derived estimates of biomass and fishing mortality. The framework developed is adaptive so that adjustments to catch or effort are recursive and can respond to changing environments, socioeconomic conditions, and fishing practices. Using stakeholder-defined objectives as a foundation, indicators and reference points of fishery performance are chosen that can be evaluated easily by undertaking analyses of available data. Indicators from multiple data streams are used so that uncertainty in one indicator can be hedged through careful interpretation and corroboration of information from alternative indicators. During the adaptive management cycle, managers and stakeholders evaluate each indicator against the associated reference points to determine performance measures, interpret the results using scientific and local knowledge, and adjust fishery management tactics accordingly using pre-defined harvest control rules. The framework facilitates the interpretation of situations in which performance measures suggest divergent stock abundance or productivity levels. A case study is presented on this framework's development for conch and lobster fisheries of Belize.},

As the number of studies using passive acoustic telemetry technology has grown in recent years, so has membership in regional collaborative networks in which methodologies and detection data are shared among researchers. These networks can significantly augment research projects by increasing the geographic coverage of detection data beyond the initial monitored area, and encourage the development of research collaborations with the goal of improving aquatic research management. As tags expire and projects end, researchers must decide whether to maintain their receiver stations, adjust the configuration to accommodate a new scope of research, or remove the stations. We assessed telemetry data from two projects designed to monitor fishes in nearshore and offshore habitats of the eastern Gulf of Mexico to determine the configuration of receiver stations most informative for network scale monitoring. Modeled on the Index of Relative Importance commonly used to analyze fish diets, the Receiver Efficiency Index (REI) allowed us to reduce the size of the two arrays from 59 to 24 and 33 to 21 stations, reductions of 59% and 27%, while retaining more than 75% of all detections. The application of this method has general relevance to understanding the spatial dynamics of these arrays while providing researchers with a quantitative tool to guide decision making that can maximize spatial coverage at the lowest maintenance cost.},

The combination of fisheries-dependent data (FDD) obtained from logbooks , and local ecological knowledge (LEK) gathered from key stakeholders could be a powerful approach to inform data gaps in data-limited fisheries. In this study, we used both FDD from guides' catch reports and LEK using an online survey and key-informant interviews to reconstruct the spatial changes in bonefish (Albula vulpes) catch and fishing effort throughout South Florida over the past 35-40 years, and better understand the extent and spatial patterns of the bonefish decline described in previous studies. Although anglers perceived a decline of bonefish numbers across all fishing areas (26 to 53% drop across Biscayne Bay, the Florida Keys, and Florida Bay), the start of the bonefish decline in Florida Bay resulted in the highest drop in bonefish number (53%); thus, indicating both regional and localized decline events affecting bonefish abundance. Within Florida Bay, LEK and FDD concurred with an initial drop in bonefish at Inner Bay, followed by a greater magnitude of decline at Outer Bay. Metrics of effort derived from the survey and interviews depicted a shrinkage and aggregation in the spatial distribution of fishing and a shift of fishing activities toward the Lower Keys. In sum, the spatiotemporal patterns of catch and effort obtained from LEK and FDD allowed us to understand where, when and how this data-limited species declined in South Florida.},

   abstract = {Many estimation and inference problems arising from large-scale animal surveys are focused on developing an understanding of patterns in abundance or occurrence of a species based on spatially referenced count data. One fundamental challenge, then, is that it is generally not feasible to completely enumerate (''census'') all individuals present in each sample unit. This observation bias may consist of several components, including spatial coverage bias (not all individuals in the population are exposed to sampling) and detection bias (exposed individuals may go undetected). Thus, observations are biased for the state variable (abundance, occupancy) that is the object of inference. Moreover, data are often sparse for most observation locations, requiring consideration of methods for spatially aggregating or otherwise combining sparse data among sample units. The development of methods that unify spatial statistical models with models accommodating non-detection is necessary to resolve important spatial inference problems based on animal survey data. In this paper, we develop a novel hierarchical spatial model for estimation of abundance and occurrence from survey data wherein detection is imperfect. Our application is focused on spatial inference problems in the Swiss Survey of Common Breeding Birds. The observation model for the survey data is specified conditional on the unknown quadrat population size, N(s). We augment the observation model with a spatial process model for N(s), describing the spatial variation in abundance of the species. The model includes explicit sources of variation in habitat structure (forest, elevation) and latent variation in the form of a correlated spatial process. This provides a model-based framework for combining the spatially referenced samples while at the same time yielding a unified treatment of estimation problems involving both abundance and occurrence. We provide a Bayesian framework for analysis and prediction based on the integrated likelihood, and we use the model to obtain estimates of abundance and occurrence maps for the European Jay (Garrulus glandarius), a widespread, elusive, forest bird. The naive national abundance estimate ignoring imperfect detection and incomplete quadrat coverage was 77 766 territories. Accounting for imperfect detection added approximately 18 000 territories, and adjusting for coverage bias added another 131 000 territories to yield a fully corrected estimate of the national total of about 227 000 territories. This is approximately three times as high as previous estimates that assume every territory is detected in each quadrat.},

   abstract = {M. 2005. Modelling occurrence and abundance of species when detection is imperfect. Á/ Oikos 110: 353 Á/359. Relationships between species abundance and occupancy are of considerable interest in metapopulation biology and in macroecology. Such relationships may be described concisely using probability models that characterize variation in abundance of a species. However, estimation of the parameters of these models in most ecological problems is impaired by imperfect detection. When organisms are detected imperfectly, observed counts are biased estimates of true abundance, and this induces bias in stated occupancy or occurrence probability. In this paper we consider a class of models that enable estimation of abundance/occupancy relationships from counts of organisms that result from surveys in which detection is imperfect. Under such models, parameter estimation and inference are based on conventional likelihood methods. We provide an application of these models to geographically extensive breeding bird survey data in which alternative models of abundance are considered that include factors that influence variation in abundance and detectability. Using these models, we produce estimates of abundance and occupancy maps that honor important sources of spatial variation in avian abundance and provide clearly interpretable characterizations of abundance and occupancy adjusted for imperfect detection.},

   abstract = {1. Presence-only data, for which there is no information on locations where the species is absent, are common in both animal and plant studies. In many situations, these may be the only data available on a species. We need effective ways to use these data to explore species distribution or species use of habitat. 2. Many analytical approaches have been used to model presence-only data, some inappropriately. We provide a synthesis and critique of statistical methods currently in use to both estimate and evaluate these models, and discuss the critical importance of study design in models where only presence can be identified 3. Profile or envelope methods exist to characterize environmental covariates that describe the locations where organisms are found. Predictions from profile approaches are generally coarse, but may be useful when species records, environmental predictors and biological understanding are scarce. 4. Alternatively, one can build models to contrast environmental attributes associated with known locations with a sample of random landscape locations, termed either 'pseudo-absences' or 'available'. Great care needs to be taken when selecting random landscape locations, because the way in which they are selected determines the modelling techniques that can be applied. 5. Regression-based models can provide predictions of the relative likelihood of occurrence , and in some situations predictions of the probability of occurrence. The logistic model is frequently applied, but can rarely be used directly to estimate these models; instead, case-control or logistic discrimination should be used depending on the sample design. 6. Cross-validation can be used to evaluate model performance and to assess how effectively the model reflects a quantity proportional to the probability of occurrence. However , more research is needed to develop a single measure or statistic that summarizes model performance for presence-only data. 7. Synthesis and applications. A number of statistical procedures are available to explore patterns in presence-only data; the choice among them depends on the quality of the presence-only data. Presence-only records can provide insight into the vulnerability, historical distribution and conservation status of species. Models developed using these data can inform management. Our caveat is that researchers must be mindful of study design and the biases inherent in presence data, and be cautious in the interpretation of model predictions.},

Was the species there but not detected, or was the species genuinely absent? Not accounting for imperfect detection of the species leads to misleading conclusions about the status of the population under study. Here some recent modelling developments are reviewed that explicitly allow for the detection process, enabling unbiased estimation of occupancy, colonization and local extinction probabilities. The methods are illustrated with a simple analysis of presence/absence data collected on larvae and meta-morphs of tiger salamander (Ambystoma tigrinum) in 2000 and 2001 from Minnesota farm ponds, which highlights that misleading conclusions can result from na¨ıvena¨ıve analyses that do not explicitly account for imperfect detection.},

   abstract = {Effective detection of population trend is crucial for managing threatened species. Little theory exists, however, to assist managers in choosing the most cost-effective monitoring techniques for diagnosing trend. We present a framework for determining the optimal monitoring strategy by simulating a manager collecting data on a declining species, the Chestnut-rumped Hylacola (Hylacola pyrrhopygia parkeri), to determine whether the species should be listed under the IUCN (World Conservation Union) Red List. We compared the efficiencies of two strategies for detecting trend, abundance, and presence-absence surveys, under financial constraints. One might expect the abundance surveys to be superior under all circumstances because more information is collected at each site. Nevertheless, the presence-absence data can be collected at more sites because the surveyor is not obliged to spend a fixed amount of time at each site. The optimal strategy for monitoring was very dependent on the budget available. Under some circumstances, presence-absence surveys outperformed abundance surveys for diagnosing the IUCN Red List categories cost-effectively. Abundance surveys were best if the species was expected to be recorded more than 16 times/year; otherwise, presence-absence surveys were best. The relationship between the strategies we investigated is likely to be relevant for many comparisons of presence-absence or abundance data. Managers of any cryptic or low-density species who hope to maximize their success of estimating trend should find an application for our results. Resumen: La detección efectiva de la tendencia de una población es crucial para la gestión de especies amenazadas. Sin embargo, existe poca teoría para asistir a los gestores en la selección de las técnicas más rentables para el monitoreo de una tendencia diagnosticada. Presentamos un marco de referencia para de-terminar la estrategiá optima de monitoreo mediante la simulación de un gestor que recolecta datos de una especie en declinación, Hylacola pyrrhopygia parkeri, para determinar si la especie debiera estar enlistada bajo los criterios de la IUCN (Unión Mundial para la Conservación). Comparamos la eficiencia de dos estrategias para detectar tendencia-monitoreos de presencia-ausencia y de abundancia-bajo limitaciones financieras. Se podría esperar que los monitoreos de abundancia sean superiores porque se recolecta más información en cada sitio. Sin embargo, los datos de presencia-ausencia se pueden recolectar en más sitios porque el obser-vador no debe estar un tiempo fijo en cada sitio. La estrategiá optima de monitoreo fue muy dependiente del presupuesto disponible: Bajo algunas circunstancias, los monitoreos de presencia-ausencia fueron mejores que los de abundancia para diagnosticar las categorías de la Lista Roja IUCN rentablemente. Los monitoreos de abundancia fueron mejores si se esperaba que la especie fuera registrada más de 16 veces por año; de lo con-trario, los monitoreos de presencia-ausencia fueron mejores. Es probable que la relación entre las estrategias que investigamos sea relevante para muchas comparaciones de datos de presencia-ausencia o abundancia. Los gestores de cualquier especie críptica o de baja densidad que esperan maximizar sú exito en la estimación de tendencias deben encontrar una aplicación para nuestros resultados.},

   abstract = {For several decades, the fisheries stock assessment paradigms of virtual population analysis (VPA) and statistical catch-at-age (SCA) models have been routinely applied to major fish stocks, and their prevalence often dictated by historical continuity, local experience, and geographical differences in standard practices. Similarly, there is a growing split among models using short and long time-series. In one approach, only the recent time-series, where the data are relatively complete, and the assumptions about stationarity in population and sampling processes are relatively simple, are included. In the other, long time-series include far more historical data, but necessitate the relaxation of many common assumptions regarding stationarity. Unlike scientific paradigms in fields outside of fisheries science where empirical validation can provide a growing body of irrefutable evidence (such as physics), there is no expectation that some "truth" will emerge or that a single best stock assessment modelling approach will ultimately displace the others. The 2013 Pacific halibut SCA stock assessment, with the addition of a VPA-based analysis, is used to illustrate how an ensemble approach can represent a more complete description of the uncertainty in management quantities, relative to selecting just one of these competing model paradigms. We suggest that risk assessment for fisheries management, based on stock assessment models, should seek to avoid binary decisions about which models to include, and instead seek better approaches to incorporate alternative models. The ensemble approach to stock assessment also provides a conceptual link between traditional "best model" analyses and fully developed management strategy evaluation of harvest policy and management procedures.},

   abstract = {Fishery managers must often reconcile conflicting estimates of population status and trend. Superensemble models, commonly used in climate and weather forecasting, may provide an effective solution. This approach uses predictions from multiple models as covariates in an additional "superensemble" model fitted to known data. We evaluated the potential for ensemble averages and superensemble models (ensemble methods) to improve estimates of population status and trend for fisheries. We fit four widely applicable data-limited models that estimate stock biomass relative to equilibrium biomass at maximum sustainable yield (B/B MSY). We combined these estimates of recent fishery status and trends in B/B MSY with four ensemble methods: an ensemble average and three superensembles (a linear model, a random forest and a boosted regression tree). We trained our superensembles on 5,760 simulated stocks and tested them with cross-validation and against a global database of 249 stock assessments. Ensemble methods substantially improved estimates of population status and trend. Random forest and boosted regression trees performed the best at estimating population status: inaccuracy (median absolute proportional error) decreased from 0.42-0.56 to 0.32-0.33, rank-order correlation between predicted and true status},

Applying a suite of data-limited methods to global catch data, combined through an ensemble modeling approach, we provide quantitative estimates of exploitation status for 785 fish stocks. Fifty-three percent (414 stocks) are below B MSY and of these, 265 are estimated to be below 80% of the B MSY level. While the 149 stocks above 80% of B MSY are conventionally considered "fully exploited," stocks staying at this level for many years, forego substantial yield. Our results enable managers to consider more detailed information than simply a categorization of stocks as "fully" or "over" exploited. Our approach is reproducible, allows consistent application to a broad range of stocks, and can be easily updated as new data become available. Applied on an ongoing basis , this approach can provide critical, more detailed information for resource management for more exploited fish stocks than currently available.},

   abstract = {Hydropower dam construction is expanding rapidly in Central America because of the increasing demand for electricity. Although hydropower can provide a low-carbon source of energy, dams can also degrade socially valued riverine and riparian ecosystems and the services they provide. Such degradation can be partially mitigated by the release of environmental flows below dams. However, environmental flows have been applied infrequently to dams in Central America, partly because of the lack of information on the ecological, social, and economic aspects of rivers. This paper presents a case study of how resource and information limitations were addressed in the development of environmental flow recommendations for the Patuca River in Honduras below a proposed hydroelectric dam. To develop flow recommendations, we applied a multistep process that included hydrological analysis and modeling, the collection of traditional ecological knowledge (TEK) during field trips, expert consultation, and environmental flow workshops for scientists, water managers, and community members. The final environmental flow recommendation specifies flow ranges for different components of river hydrology, including low flows for each month, high-flow pulses, and floods, in dry, normal, and wet years. The TEK collected from local and indigenous riverine communities was particularly important for forming hypotheses about flow-dependent ecological and social factors that may be vulnerable to disruption from dam-modified river flows. We show that our recommended environmental flows would have a minimal impact on the dam's potential to generate electricity. In light of rapid hydropower development in Central America, we suggest that environmental flows are important at the local scale, but that an integrated landscape perspective is ultimately needed to pursue hydropower development in a manner that is as ecologically sustainable as possible.},

   abstract = {Spatial catch per effort data can provide useful indices of population trends provided that they are averaged so as to correct for effects of changes in the distribution of fishing activity. Simple, nonspatial ratio estimates should not be used in such analyses. The averaging for any time period must necessarily make some assumptions about what catch rates would have been in spatial strata that had not yet, or were no longer, being fished. Ignoring the unfished strata (averaging only over the areas that were fished) amounts to assuming that they behaved the same as the fished strata and can lead to severe hyperdepletion in abundance indices for fisheries that developed progressively over large regions.

Des estimations simples et non spatiales de rapports ne doivent pas être utili-sés dans de telles analyses. Le calcul des moyennes pour chaque période de temps doit nécessairement établir des pré-suppositions sur ce qu'auraient été les taux de capture dans les strates spatiales dans lesquelles on n'a pas encore pêché ou dans lesquelles la pêche a cessé. Si on ne tient pas compte des strates où il ne se fait pas de pêche (en cal-culant les moyennes seulement à partir des zones de pêche), on assume que toutes les strates réagissent de la même fa-çon, qu'il y ait ou non de la pêche; cela peut mener à une sévère hyperdéplétion dans les indices d'abondance pour les pêches commerciales qui ont évolué progressivement sur de grands espaces.

Apart from the fact that generalized linear models are better suited in dealing with count data, a log-transformation of counts has the additional quandary in how to deal with zero observations. With just one zero observation (if this observation represents a sampling unit), the whole data set needs to be fudged by adding a value (usually 1) before transformation. 3. Simulating data from a negative binomial distribution, we compared the outcome of fitting models that were transformed in various ways (log, square root) with results from fitting models using quasi-Poisson and negative binomial models to untransformed count data. 4. We found that the transformations performed poorly, except when the dispersion was small and the mean counts were large. The quasi-Poisson and negative binomial models consistently performed well, with little bias. 5. We recommend that count data should not be analysed by log-transforming it, but instead models based on Poisson and negative binomial distributions should be used.},

Based on the generalized information criterion, the ZINB regression model provided a better fit to the data than either Poisson, negative binomial or zero-inflated Poisson regression models. To demonstrate the utility of the ZINB regression model for the standardization of catch data, standardized temporal trends in bycatch rates estimated with the ZINB regression model are computed and compared to those obtained from fits of the other three types of models to the same data. With the exception of the negative binomial, estimated temporal trends were more similar among models than would have been inferred from an analysis of model fit. Comparison of trends among models suggests that the negative binomial regression model may overestimate model coefficients when fitted to data with many zero-valued observations.},

   abstract = {Fishery catch per effort (CPE) is often used to assess relative fish abundance, and in many Great Lakes and other freshwater applications the CPE index is based on either an average or the ratio of summed aggregate catch to summed aggregate effort. In particular, assessments used to estimate the abundance of lake whitefish Coregonus clupeaformis and recommend harvest quotas in 1836 Treaty-ceded waters of Lakes Huron, Michigan, and Superior assume that commercial CPE from gill-net and trap-net fisheries is proportional to abundance; however, CPE may change due to factors other than abundance, leading to violations of this assumption. To account for sources of CPE variation that are not attributable to abundance, general linear mixed models (GLMMs) were developed for each management unit and least-squares means (LSMs) for each year were used as the index of abundance. The effect of using the GLMM method for standardization was evaluated by examining the temporal trends in the proportional difference between LSMs and CPE (i.e., aggregate catch divided by aggregate effort for each year). Of the random effects included in the final GLMM for the gill-net fishery, license holder accounted for the most variation. The fixed effect of boat size category on CPE depended on lake; on average, there was little difference between boat sizes in Lake Superior, whereas large boats had a lower CPE than medium and small boats in Lakes Michigan and Huron. On average, CPE was higher from October to December than during other months. The proportional difference between LSMs and CPE trended through time in some management units, suggesting the importance of adjusting fishery CPE for effects like boat size, season, and license holder. Factors that influence lake whitefish commercial fishery CPE are similar to factors important for marine commercial fisheries.},

This investigation is the first to include data for the 2006-2010 cold period and to use between-year comparisons of local and shelf-wide spatial indices to test specific responses to three different isothermal boundaries within the cold pool. Distributional shifts in population varied considerably among species and directional vectors for some species were greater in magnitude to the east or west than to the north or south; however, in general, eastern Bering Sea shelf populations shifted southward in response to the increasing cold pool size, and after accounting for differences in temperature and population abundance, there was still a temporal northward shift in populations over the last three decades despite the recent cooling trend. Model results for local and shelf-wide indices showed that survey time lag and cold pool extent had a greater effect on spatial distribution than population abundance, suggesting that density-independent mechanisms play a major role in shaping distribution patterns on the eastern Bering Sea shelf. The area enclosed by the 1 1C isotherm most commonly affects both local and shelf-wide spatial indices suggesting that 1 1C is a more important boundary for describing temperature preferences of eastern Bering Sea bottom fishes and crabs than is the 2 1C isotherm used for designating the physical boundary for the cold pool.

   abstract = {Fishery-independent (FI) surveys provide critical information used for the sustainable management and conservation of fish populations. Because fisheries management often requires the effects of management actions to be evaluated and detected within a relatively short time frame, it is important that research be directed toward FI survey evaluation, especially with respect to the ability to detect temporal trends. Using annual FI gill-net survey data for Lake Erie walleyes Sander vitreus collected from 1978 to 2006 as a case study, our goals were to (1) highlight the usefulness of hierarchical models for estimating spatial and temporal sources of variation in catch per effort (CPE); (2) demonstrate how the resulting variance estimates can be used to examine the statistical power to detect temporal trends in CPE in relation to sample size, duration of sampling, and decisions regarding what data are most appropriate for analysis; and (3) discuss recommendations for evaluating FI surveys and analyzing the resulting data to support fisheries management. This case study illustrated that the statistical power to detect temporal trends was low over relatively short sampling periods (e.g., 5-10 years) unless the annual decline in CPE reached 10-20%. For example, if 50 sites were sampled each year, a 10% annual decline in CPE would not be detected with more than 0.80 power until 15 years of sampling, and a 5% annual decline would not be detected with more than 0.8 power for approximately 22 years. Because the evaluation of FI surveys is essential for ensuring that trends in fish populations can be detected over management-relevant time periods, we suggest using a meta-analysis-type approach across systems to quantify sources of spatial and temporal variation. This approach can be used to evaluate and identify sampling designs that increase the ability of managers to make inferences about trends in fish stocks. Fishery-independent (FI) surveys help fulfill a variety of fisheries management objectives, including assessing stock status and trends, setting annual harvest levels, and evaluating the effects of natural and anthropogenic stressors on the spatiotemporal dynamics of populations (Quinn and Deriso 1999; Sitar et al. 1999; Allen et al. 2007). Although data derived from FI surveys are used to fulfill many objectives, one of the most common uses of these data is to infer changes in indices of relative abundance over time (Pennington and Strømme 1998; Stobutzki et al. 2006; Corradin et al. 2008). Knowledge of rates of population decline or increase is critical to maintain sustainable management of exploited species and to assess recovery efforts for species of high conservation priority (Zwieten et al. 2002; Maxwell and Jennings 2005). In addition, fisheries management often requires the effects of management actions to be evaluated and detected within a relatively short time frame, such as 5 years (Zwieten et al. 2002). Therefore, quantifying the magnitude of change in the relative abundance of a population that can be detected from FI surveys has important implications for the time scale needed for managers to evaluate management actions, detect changes attributable to sources other than management (e.g., invasive species), and-to avoid undesirable changes in abundance-respond and take appropriate action. Much research has been conducted on various aspects of sampling methodology and on the efficiency of different gear types used during FI surveys. For example, the design of statistically valid FI surveys for monitoring fish populations has been acknowledged as essential to ensure that inferences regarding status and trends can be generalized to a population of interest},

   abstract = {Spatio-temporal models have become key tools for evaluating population trends and habitat usage. We developed a spatio-temporal modelling framework employing a combination of encounter/non-encounter, count, and biomass data collected by different monitoring programs ("combined data"). The three data types are predicted using a computationally efficient approximation to a compound Poisson-gamma process. We fitted spatio-temporal models to combined data for Gulf of Mexico (GOM) red snapper (Lutjanus campechanus) for 2006-2014. These spatio-temporal models provided insights into GOM red snapper spatial distribution patterns, which we corroborated by comparing to past predictions generated using only encounter/non-encounter data. However, relying on biomass and count data in addition to encounter/ non-encounter data also allowed us to reconstruct biomass trends for GOM red snapper and to examine patterns of distribution shifts and range expansion/contraction for this population for the first time. Moreover, combining multiple data types improved the precision of reconstructed population trends and some variables quantifying habitat usage. Finally, scenarios and simulation experiments conditioned upon red snapper data showed that the improvement in fitting to combined data is greater when biomass data for the study population are lacking for an entire subregion and, to a lesser extent, for an entire time period (e.g. in early years).},

   abstract = {Long-term sampling of fisheries data is an important source of information for making inferences about the temporal dynamics of populations that support ecologically and economically important fisheries. For example, time series of catch-per-effort data are often examined for the presence of long-term trends. However, it is also of interest to know whether certain sampled locations are exhibiting temporal patterns that deviate from the overall pattern exhibited across all sampled locations. Patterns at these "unusual" sites may be the result of site-specific abiotic (e.g., habitat) or biotic (e.g., the presence of an invasive species) factors that cause these sites to respond differently to natural or anthropogenic drivers of population dynamics or to management actions. We present a Bayesian model selection approach that allows for detection of unique sites-locations that display temporal patterns with documentable inconsistencies relative to the overall global average temporal pattern. We applied this modeling approach to long-term gill-net data collected from a fixed-site, standardized sampling program for Yellow Perch Perca flavescens in Oneida Lake, New York, but the approach is also relevant to shorter time series data. We used this approach to identify six sites with distinct temporal patterns that differed from the lakewide trend, and we describe the magnitude of the difference between these patterns and the lakewide average trend. Detection of unique sites may be informative for management decisions related to prioritizing rehabilitation or restoration efforts, stocking, or determining fishable areas and for further understanding changes in ecosystem dynamics.},

   abstract = {this species is establishing long-term baseline trends in abundance. In the absence of scientific survey data, assessing and monitoring the status of some marine species has required the utilization of fishery-dependent data. Using voluntary dockside interviews of sport fishers collected in Everglades National Park, a standardized index of abundance was created for smalltooth sawfish using the delta method. The index was developed as the product of separate generalized linear models of the proportion of positive trips and the positive catch rates on successful trips. Development of the final model included testing factors that were expected to influence the catch of smalltooth sawfish. The final model assumed a binomial distribution for the proportion of positive trips and a lognormal distribution for positive catch rates. Year was significant as a main effect in the binomial model whereas year and skill level of the fishing party were significant in the lognormal model. The relative abundance index shows a small increase in abundance at an average rate of about 5% per year since 1989. These results indicate that the population of smalltooth saw-fish in Everglades National Park has at least stabilized and may be increasing. However, additional data and analyses from multiple sources are required before definitive conclusions on the recovery of smalltooth sawfish can be established.},

Catch-per-unit-effort (CPUE) data from fisheries have traditionally been used to measure changes in relative abundance, but accumulated evidence indicates that interpreting CPUE data from commercial fisheries is difficult, particularly for pelagic fish, because commercial CPUE data are affected by changes in fishing efficiency over time and tend to decline more slowly than abundance (Bannerot and Austin 1983; MacCall 1984). A number of alternative fishery-independent procedures for estimating relative abundance of fishes have keen developed including scientifically designed acoustic surveys, trawl surveys, egg and larva surveys, aerial surveys, and tagging experiments (Ulltang 1977). These approaches may provide good results but are expensive. In contrast , aerial "fish spotters" are a potential source ~f large yuan-tities of inexpensive information about relative abundance of pelagic fish that can be obtained from existing coinmercial operations.

   abstract = {A new habitat-based model is developed to improve estimates of relative abundance of Pacific bigeye tuna (Thunnus obesus). The model provides estimates of 'effective' longline effort and therefore better estimates of catch-per-unit-of-effort (CPUE) by incorporating information on the variation in longline fishing depth and depth of bigeye tuna preferred habitat. The essential elements in the model are: (1) estimation of the depth distribution of the longline gear, using information on gear configuration and ocean currents; (2) estimation of the depth distribution of bigeye tuna, based on habitat preference and oceanographic data; (3) estimation of effective longline effort, using fine-scale Japanese longline fishery data; and (4) aggrega-tion of catch and effective effort over appropriate spatial zones to produce revised time series of CPUE. Model results indicate that effective effort has increased in both the western and central Pacific Ocean (WCPO) and eastern Pacific Ocean (EPO). In the WCPO, effective effort increased by 43% from the late 1960s to the late 1980s due primarily to the increased effectiveness of effort (deeper longline sets) rather than to increased nominal effort. Over the same period, effective effort increased 250% in the EPO due primarily to increased nominal effort. Nominal and standardized CPUE indices in the EPO show similar trends-a decline during the 1960s, a period of stability in the 1970s, high values during 1985-1986 and a decline thereafter. In the WCPO, nominal CPUE is stable over the time-series; however, standardized CPUE has declined by $50%. If estimates of standardized CPUE accurately reflect relative abundance, then we have documented substantial reductions of bigeye tuna abundance for some regions in the Pacific Ocean. A decline in standardized CPUE in the subtropical gyres concurrent with stability in equatorial areas may represent a contraction in the range of the population resulting from a decline in population abundance. The sensitivity of the results to the habitat (temperature and oxygen) assumptions was tested using Monte Carlo simulations.},

In addition to estimating catchability coefficients, the technique accounts for error in the measurement of relative abundance. A general-purpose nonlinear regression subroutine was used to fit the model. The technique is demonstrated using Northeast Fisheries Center bottom trawl suwey data as a masure of relative abundance. Fitting was carried out for four fish populations: Georges Bank and Southern New England yellowtail flounder (LimaPulaz femuginea); Georges Bank and NAFO SA 4X haddock (Melanograzmrnus wegkegineks). Catchability coefficients calculated in this manner are consistent with prior estimates. In addition, the technique smooths the survey data by filtering measurement error from true fluctuations in population size. Population size estimates for haddock derived by ahis method agree closely with virtual population analysis (VPA) estimates. COLLIE, J. S. , AND M. $. SISSENWINE. 1983.

DIRECT enumeration of a marine fish population over a large area is not generally pssible; therefore, indirect methods of estimating population size are necessary. Standardized catch-per-unit-effort indices (based on either fishery or research vessel data) provide a measure of relative abundance; i.e. rz = qN where n is relative abundance, N is absolute population size, and q is a parameter called the catchability coefficient. Catch-per-unit-effort data from commercial or recreational fisheries are difficult to standardize such that q is constant. Technological improvements increase fishing power and bias standardized indices. Therefore, standardized research vessel survey data are now broadly applied to monitor trends in population size ((Clark 1979; Sissenwine et al. 1983). Absolute abundance is determined by calibrating n (esti-mating q) using other independent information. One approach is to estimate the efficiency of sampling gear 4i.e. q) by comparing survey catches with direct enumeration (using sub-mersible or camera sleds, for example, Uzmann et al. 1977) within a relatively small area. Unfortunately, estimates of q for any specific area are not necessarily representative of a Can.},

We demonstrated high correspondence between standardized indices produced through the years analyzed independent of the species evaluated, indicating there was little change in the information content between indices. Despite the agreement between the indices, estimates for proportion positive and coefficient of variation (CV) showed a general reduction in precision when using the MeanCount method for all species analyzed. Systematic underestimation of proportion positives and high CV values generated using MeanCount is problematic for the use of that abundance estimation method. Individual-based modeling results confirmed that MeanCount is linearly related to true abundance, while MaxN showed a power relationship. However, the MaxN estimate became linear as the area observed was increased in the model from 25% to 100%, which suggests that syncing cameras and generating counts over the entire observed area would eliminate the asymptotic relationship and simplify the use of MaxN estimators. Better understanding of catchability for optical type gears would enhance understanding of the relationship between the generated index and true population abundance, and supply assessment scientist with a clearer understanding of how to incorporate these types of survey data into assessments.

   abstract = {Indices of abundance are the bedrock for stock assessments or empirical management procedures used to manage fishery catches for fish populations worldwide, and are generally obtained by processing catch-rate data. Recent research suggests that geostatistical models can explain a substantial portion of variability in catch rates via the location of samples (i.e. whether located in high-or low-density habitats), and thus use available catch-rate data more efficiently than conventional "design-based" or stratified estimators. However, the generality of this conclusion is currently unknown because geostatistical models are computationally challenging to simulation-test and have not previously been evaluated using multiple species. We develop a new maximum likelihood estimator for geostatistical index standardization, which uses recent improvements in estimation for Gaussian random fields. We apply the model to data for 28 groundfish species off the U.S. West Coast and compare results to a previous "strati-fied" index standardization model, which accounts for spatial variation using post-stratification of available data. This demonstrates that the stratified model generates a relative index with 60% larger estimation intervals than the geostatistical model. We also apply both models to simulated data and demonstrate (i) that the geostatistical model has well-calibrated confidence intervals (they include the true value at approximately the nominal rate), (ii) that neither model on average under-or overestimates changes in abundance, and (iii) that the geostatistical model has on average 20% lower estimation errors than a stratified model. We therefore conclude that the geostatistical model uses survey data more efficiently than the stratified model, and therefore provides a more cost-efficient treatment for historical and ongoing fish sampling data.},

   abstract = {Estimating trends in abundance from fishery catch rates is one of the oldest endeavors in fisheries science. However, many jurisdictions do not analyze fishery catch rates due to concerns that these data confound changes in fishing behavior (adjustments in fishing location or gear operation) with trends in abundance. In response, we developed a spatial dynamic factor analysis (SDFA) model that decomposes covariation in multispecies catch rates into components representing spatial variation and fishing behavior. SDFA estimates spatiotemporal variation in fish density for multiple species and accounts for fisher behavior at large spatial scales (i.e., choice of fishing location) while controlling for fisher behavior at fine spatial scales (e.g., daily timing of fishing activity). We first use a multispecies simulation experiment to show that SDFA decreases bias in abundance indices relative to ignoring spatial adjustments and fishing tactics. We then present results for a case study involving petrale sole (Eopsetta jordani) in the California Current, for which SDFA estimates initially stable and then increasing abundance for the period 1986-2003, in accordance with fishery-independent survey and stock assessment estimates. Résumé : L'estimation des tendances d'abondance a ` partir de taux de prises des pêches est une des pratiques les plus anciennes des sciences halieutiques. De nombreux pays n'analysent cependant pas les taux de prises des pêches parce que ces données pour-raient ne pas distinguer les modifications des comportements de pêche (ajustements du lieu de pêche ou de l'utilisation d'engins) des tendances d'abondance. Nous avons donc développé un modèle d'analyse des facteurs de dynamique spatiale (SDFA) qui décompose la covariation des taux de prises multiespèces en différentes composantes représentant la variation spatiale et le comportement de pêche. La SDFA estime les variations spatiotemporelles de densité de poissons pour des espèces multiples et tient compte du comportement de pêche a ` de grandes échelles spatiales (c.-a `-d., le choix du lieu de pêche), tout en contrôlant pour le comportement des pêcheurs a ` petites échelles spatiales (p. ex. l'heure du jour de l'activité de pêche). Nous utilisons d'abord une expérience de simulation multiespèces pour démontrer que la SDFA réduit le biais dans les indices d'abondance par rapport a ` la non-prise en compte des ajustements spatiaux et des tactiques de pêche. Nous présentons ensuite les résultats pour une étude de cas portant sur la platija prtrale (Eopsetta jordani) dans le courant de Californie, pour laquelle la SDFA estime une abondance initialement stable, puis croissante pour la période 1986-2002, ce qui concorde avec les estimations tirées d'évaluations indépendantes de la pêche et d'évaluations des stocks.

   abstract = {With the internet, a massive amount of information on species abundance can be collected by citizen science programs. However, these data are often difficult to use directly in statistical inference, as their collection is generally op-portunistic, and the distribution of the sampling effort is often not known. In this article, we develop a general statistical framework to combine such "opportunistic data" with data collected using schemes characterized by a known sampling effort. Under some structural assumptions regarding the sampling effort and detectability, our approach makes it possible to estimate the relative abundance of several species in different sites. It can be implemented through a simple generalized linear model. We illustrate the framework with typical bird datasets from the Aquitaine region in southwestern France. We show that, under some assumptions, our approach provides estimates that are more precise than the ones obtained from the dataset with a known sampling effort alone. When the opportunistic data are abundant, the gain in precision may be considerable, especially for rare species. We also show that estimates can be obtained even for species recorded only in the opportunistic scheme. Opportunistic data combined with a relatively small amount of data collected with a known effort may thus provide access to accurate and precise estimates of quantitative changes in relative abundance over space and/or time.},

   abstract = {Recreational fisheries can be prone to severe declines, yet these fisheries, particularly catch-and-release, are often data-limited, constraining our ability to conduct stock assessments. A combination of catch and effort indices derived from fisheries-dependent data (FDD) gathered from fishing logbooks could be a powerful approach to inform these data gaps. This study demonstrates the utility of using different catch metrics such as indices of abundance, species richness associated with reported catch, and the success rate of targeted trips, to assess historical shifts in the trajectory of the data-limited bonefish (Albula vulpes) fishery in Florida Bay, an economically-important recreational fishery within the Caribbean Basin. We used FDD from fishing guide reports submitted to Everglades National Park to determine temporal patterns in the bonefish population over the past 35 years. These reports indicated a decline in recreational catches in Florida Bay since the late 1980s, with an accelerated decline starting in the late 1990s-early 2000s. Analyses showed an overall 42% reduction in bonefish catches. Trends in the proportion of positive trips (i.e., the probability of catching success) followed the declining catch patterns, suggesting major population changes starting in 1999-2000. As bonefish catches declined, species richness in bonefish trips increased by 34%, suggesting a decrease in bonefish abundance and/or shift in fishing effort (e.g., giving-up time, changes in preferred species). Results provide additional resolution to a pattern of decline for bonefish in South Florida and highlight the value of reconstructing time-series for the development of hypotheses about the potential driving mechanisms of species decline. Further, the data-limited nature of most recreational fisheries, and the increase in a use of catch-and-release as a fisheries management strategy point to the need to develop further data integration tools to assess population trends and the sustainability of these fishery resources.

   abstract = {Recent large fluctuations in an index of relative abundance for the silky shark in the eastern Pacific Ocean have called into question its reliability as a population indicator for management. To investigate whether these fluctuations were driven by environmental forcing rather than true changes in abundance, a Pacific-wide approach was taken. Data collected by observers aboard purse-seine vessels fishing in the equatorial Pacific were used to compute standardized trends in relative abundance by region, and where possible, by shark size category as a proxy for life stage. These indices were compared to the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO), an index of Pacific Ocean climate variability. Correlation between silky indices and the PDO was found to differ by region and size category. The highest correlations by shark size category were for small (<90 cm total length [TL]) and medium (90-150 cm TL) sharks from the western region of the equatorial eastern Pacific (EP) and from the equatorial western Pacific. This correlation disappeared in the inshore EP. Throughout, correlations with the PDO were generally lower for large silky sharks (>150 cm TL). These results are suggestive of changes in the small and medium silky indices being driven by movement of juvenile silky sharks across the Pacific as the eastern edge of the Indo-Pacific Warm Pool shifts location with ENSO events. Lower correlation of the PDO with large shark indices may indicate that those indices were less influenced by environmental forcing and therefore potentially less biased with respect to monitoring population trends.},

   abstract = {Environmental variability changes the distribution, migratory patterns, and susceptibility to various fishing gears for highly migratory marine fish. These changes become especially problematic when they affect the indices of abundance (such as those based on catch-per-unit-effort: CPUE) used to assess the status of fish stocks. The use of simulated CPUE data sets with known values of underlying population trends has been recommended by ICCAT (International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas) to test the robustness of CPUE standardization methods. A longline CPUE data simulator was developed to meet this objective and simulate fisheries data from a population with distinct habitat preferences. The simulation was used to test several statistical hypotheses regarding best practices for index standardization aimed at accurate estimation of population trends. Effort data from the US pelagic longline fleet was paired with a volume-weighted habitat suitability model for blue marlin (Makaira nigricans) to derive a simulated time series of blue marlin catch and effort from 1986 to 2015 with four different underlying population trends. The simulated CPUE data were provided to stock assessment scientists to determine if the underlying population abundance trend could accurately be detected with different methods of CPUE standardization that did or did not incorporate environmental data. While the analysts' approach to the data and the modeling structure differed, the underlying population trends were captured, some more successfully than others. In general, the inclusion of environmental and habitat variables aided the standardization process. However, differences in approaches highlight the importance of how explanatory variables are categorized and the criteria for including those variables. A set of lessons learned from this study was developed as recommendations for best practices for CPUE standardization.},

   abstract = {The majority of catch per unit effort (cpue) standardizations use generalized linear models (GLMs) or generalized additive models (GAMs). We develop geostatistical models that model catch locations as continuous Gaussian random fields (GRFs) and apply them to standardizing cpue in Australia's Eastern Tuna and Billfish Fishery (ETBF). The results are compared with the traditional GLMs currently used in ETBF assessments as well as GAMs. Specifically, we compare seven models in three groups: two GLMs, two GAMs, and three GRF models. Within each group, one model treats spatial and temporal variables independently, while the other model(s) treats them together as an interaction term. The two spatio-temporal GRF models differ in treating the spatial-temporal interaction: either as a random process or as an autoregressive process. We simulate catch rate data for five pelagic species based on real fishery catch rates so that the simulated data reflect real fishery patterns while the "true" annual abundance levels are known. The results show that within each group, the model with a spatial-temporal interaction term significantly outperforms the other model treating spatial and temporal variables independently. For spatial-temporal models between the three groups, prediction accuracy tends to improve from GLM to GAM and to the GRF models. Overall, the spatio-temporal GRF autoregressive model reduces mean relative predictive error by 43.4% from the GLM, 33.9% from the GAM, and reduces mean absolute predictive error by 23.5% from the GLM and 3.3% from the GAM, respectively. The comparison suggests a promising direction for further developing the geostatistical models for the ETBF.},

   abstract = {Data from coastal fisheries are often incomplete, as these fisheries are usually small in scale, rendering them exempt from logbook submission requirements. The catch of Dolphinfish Coryphaena hippurus by Taiwanese fisheries once ranked second in the world but has dramatically declined to very low levels in recent years. To address this decline, assessment of a Dolphinfish abundance index was necessary. However, due to the small scale of the fisheries, logbook data were not available to calculate CPUE. This study aimed to estimate a statistically reliable index by (1) assigning effort matrices to landings data using coastal surveillance radar data; (2) standardizing the 2001-2015 CPUEs while using four approaches (classifying fishing tactics by multivariate techniques and principal components analysis) to differentiate the fisheries' effort toward catching Dolphinfish from the effort toward other target species; and (3) evaluating performance of the standardization models by using an R 2 estimated by cross-validation and boot-strap procedures. The approach that used a delta-generalized additive model with a direct principal components procedure demonstrated the best fit. This study presents an example of deriving a statistically reliable abundance index from the data-incomplete situations common for coastal fisheries, which allows for follow-up population dynamics studies. The resulting index for Dolphinfish in the Taiwanese region showed two 7-year cycles, with a prominent decline in 2015. Reasons for the fluctuation are unknown but may be due to environmental factors, the fast-growing nature of the fish, and heavy exploitation of the stock by Taiwanese fisheries.},

   abstract = {Despite the prevalence of catch per unit effort (CPUE) as a key metric in fisheries assessments it can be fraught with inherent problems that often cause its use as an index of abundance to become contentious. This is particularly the case with abalone, a sedentary shellfish targeted by commercial dive fishers around the globe. It is common practice to standardize CPUE to at least partly address issues about how well it reflects the actual abundance of a stock. Differences between standardized and unstan-dardized trends may lead to controversy between scientists and stakeholders when standardized trends provide a less optimistic picture of stock status. It is within this context that we applied Linear Mixed Model (LMM) and Generalized Linear Mixed Model (GLMM) methods to standardize CPUE for the Western Zone blacklip abalone fishery in Victoria, Australia. This fishery was chosen for our evaluation because it included substantial population losses from a disease shock during the middle of the time series. The effects of diver, reef location, month and their interactions with year were included as random effects in these models and the results compared with nominal geometric means. The two standardization methods provided similar standardized CPUE trends and clearly demonstrated that a large proportion of the variance could be attributed to diver and spatial effects. The GLMM seemed to explain more variability in the data and produced better precision for standardized CPUEs than LMM. The temporal trend in variability attributed to divers and spatial scales reveals the impact of disease as well as any homo/heterogeneity effect. The CPUE trends responded to the impact of disease against a backdrop of declining stock, however when compared with the inter-annual pattern in nominal CPUE, the standardized trends showed that the decline immediately following the onset of disease was less precipitous. In contrast to what appeared to be an increase in the nominal series during the more recent post-disease period, there was only a slight non-significant increase observable in the standardized trends.},

   abstract = {Many stock assessments heavily rely on indices of relative abundance derived from fisheries-dependent catch-per-unit-effort (CPUE) data. Therefore, it is critical to evaluate different CPUE standardization methods under varying scenarios of data generating processes. Here, we evaluated nine CPUE standardization methods offering contrasting treatments of spatio-temporal variation, ranging from the basic generalized linear model (GLM) method not integrating a year-area interaction term to a sophisticated method using the spatio-temporal mod-eling platform VAST. We compared the performance of these methods against simulated data constructed to mimic the processes generating fisheries-dependent information for Atlantic blue marlin (Makaira nigricans), a common bycatch population in pelagic longline fisheries. Data were generated using a longline data simulator for different population trajectories (increasing, decreasing, and static). These data were further subsampled to mimic an observer program where trips rather than sets form the sampling frame, with or without a bias towards trips with low catch rates, which might occur if the presence of an observer alters fishing behavior to avoid bycatch. The spatio-temporal modeling platform VAST achieved the best performance in simulation, namely generally had one of the lowest biases, one of the lowest mean absolute errors (MAEs), and 50% confidence interval coverage closest to 50%. Generalized additive models accounting for spatial autocorrelation at a broad spatial scale (one of the lowest MAEs and one of the lowest biases) and, to a lesser extent, non-spatial delta-lognormal GLMs including a year-area interaction as a random effect (one of the lowest MAEs and one of the best confidence interval coverages) also performed adequately. The VAST method provided the most comprehensive and consistent treatment of spatio-temporal variation, in contrast with methods that simply weight predictions by large spatial areas, where it is critical, but difficult, to get the a priori spatial stratification correct before weighting. Next, we applied the CPUE standardization methods to real data collected by the National Marine Fisheries Service Pelagic Observer Program. The indices of relative abundance predicted from real observer data were relatively similar across CPUE standardization methods for the period 1998-2017 and suggested that the blue marlin population of the Atlantic declined over the period 1998-2004 and was relatively stable afterwards. As spatio-temporal variation related to environmental changes or depletion becomes increasingly necessary to consider, greater use of spatio-temporal models for standardizing fisheries-dependent CPUE data will likely be warranted.},

Catch-per-unit-effort (CPUE) data from fisheries have traditionally been used to measure changes in relative abundance, but accumulated evidence indicates that interpreting CPUE data from commercial fisheries is difficult, particularly for pelagic fish, because commercial CPUE data are affected by changes in fishing efficiency over time and tend to decline more slowly than abundance (Bannerot and Austin 1983; MacCall 1984). A number of alternative fishery-independent procedures for estimating relative abundance of fishes have keen developed including scientifically designed acoustic surveys, trawl surveys, egg and larva surveys, aerial surveys, and tagging experiments (Ulltang 1977). These approaches may provide good results but are expensive. In contrast , aerial "fish spotters" are a potential source ~f large yuan-tities of inexpensive information about relative abundance of pelagic fish that can be obtained from existing coinmercial operations.

We use a logistic regression of multispecies presence-absence information to predict the probability that the target species would be present. A critical value of probability that best predicts target species presence and absence in the data set forms an objective basis for subsetting the trip records.

approach to a risk analysis context. The estimation-simulation method
used length frequencies as the principal data in lieu of catch and

mortality and growth dynamics into a numerical cohort model; (ii) employ
a precautionary approach for setting sustainability reference points for
fishing mortality (FREF) and stock reproductive biomass (BREF); (iii)
define sustainability risks in terms of probability distributions; and,
(iv) evaluate exploitation status in terms of expected length
frequencies, the main observable population metric. This refined
length-based approach was applied to six principal exploited reef fish
species in the Florida Keys region, consisting of three groupers (black
grouper, red grouper, and coney), two snappers (mutton snapper and
yellowtail snapper), and one wrasse (hogfish). The estimated
sustainability risks for coney were low (<35%) in terms of benchmarks
for fishing mortality rate and stock reproductive biomass. The other
five species had estimated sustainability risks of greater than 95% for
both benchmarks. The data-limited risk analysis methodology allowed for
a fairly comprehensive probabilistic evaluation of sustainability status
from species and community perspectives, and also a frame of reference
for exploring management options balancing sustainability risks and

While the use of more advanced statistical methods has helped catch rates to be standardised against many explanatory variables, the changing spatial characteristics of most fisheries data sets provide additional challenges for constructing reliable indices of stock abundance. After reviewing the use of general linear models to construct indices of annual stock abundance, potential biases which can arise due to the unequal and changing nature of the spatial distribution of fishing effort are examined and illustrated through the analysis of simulated data.

   abstract = {The US population of smalltooth sawfish, Pristis pectinata, is currently listed as endangered under the Endangered Species Act. An important component of monitoring the recovery of this species is establishing long-term baseline trends in abundance. In the absence of scientific survey data, assessing and monitoring the status of some marine species has required the utilization of fishery-dependent data. Using voluntary dockside interviews of sport fishers collected in Everglades National Park, a standardized index of abundance was created for smalltooth sawfish using the delta method. The index was developed as the product of separate generalized linear models of the proportion of positive trips and the positive catch rates on successful trips. Development of the final model included testing factors that were expected to influence the catch of smalltooth sawfish. The final model assumed a binomial distribution for the proportion of positive trips and a lognormal distribution for positive catch rates. Year was significant as a main effect in the binomial model whereas year and skill level of the fishing party were significant in the lognormal model. The relative abundance index shows a small increase in abundance at an average rate of about 5% per year since 1989. These results indicate that the population of smalltooth sawfish in Everglades National Park has at least stabilized and may be increasing. However, additional data and analyses from multiple sources are required before definitive conclusions on the recovery of smalltooth sawfish can be established.},

It cited a recent status report that showed a significant increase in the abundance of the USA population and suggested that goliath grouper are re-establishing themselves throughout their historic range. However, under the Magnuson-Stevens Conservation Act, the goliath grouper remains ‘overfished,’ and harvest is still illegal. The historical center of abundance of goliath grouper is the Ten Thousand Islands area of southwest Florida. Detailed catch and effort data are available from this region for 1973 to 2006. The data were collected by Everglades National Park (ENP) officials during voluntary dockside interviews of sport fishermen. Using this data, a standard- ized index of abundance was created for juvenile goliath grouper. The index shows a substantial decline in abundance during the late 1970s and early 1980s. Since that time, the abundance of juve- niles within ENP has increased considerably, suggesting that strong year classes have recently occurred in ENP. This information is useful for managers and stock assessment biologists tasked to evaluate the stock status of goliath grouper, and to determine acceptable harvest levels for scientific research and/or fishing.},

   abstract = {Competition and predation can play different roles in mediating the influence of external pressures, such as fishing or environmental variations, on marine communities. Pressure effects propagate through food webs along predation links. These predator-prey interactions may result in trophic cascades, but they can be buffered by competitive interactions. We investigated these mechanisms by taking a functional-group approach. Are functional groups affected by external pressures in a predictable way? Within functional groups, do all species respond in the same way, or does competitive release allow for compensation among species? We constructed a simple community model, with functional groups connected by predation links. Loop analysis was used to make qualitative predictions of the changes in functional groups that might result through either direct or indirect effects from changes in pressures. Actual changes in biomass and average weight in functional groups were then tracked from fish trawl-survey data; compensation within groups was examined with dynamic factor analysis. This approach was applied to the Georges Bank, Bay of Biscay, and North Sea fish communities, which have been subject to different fishing regimes and have undergone environmental changes over the last decades. All three communities changed substantially. Compensation did not prevent impacts from propagating through the three food webs; rather, antagonistic pressures did. Community responses to perturbation were mostly determined by community structure and by fisheries selectivity with respect to both functional groups and species.},

   abstract = {Abstract Walleye Sander vitreus and yellow perch Perca flavescens are well-studied, ecologically important fish species that co-occur in a wide range of systems and experience complex interactions; on the one hand, they are physiologically and ecologically similar and therefore may respond analogously to environmental variation, while on the other hand they interact antagonistically as competitors, predators, and prey. In Saginaw Bay, Lake Huron, walleyes and yellow perch have supported a combination of commercial and recreational fisheries and have been exposed to a series of ecosystem-level stressors and management actions that may have impacted these populations via multiple pathways. We used dynamic factor analysis and correlation analysis of walleye and yellow perch annual fall trawl catch data to elucidate the overall trends in walleye and yellow perch populations in Saginaw Bay. The results suggest that walleyes and yellow perch trend differently; while the relative abundance of age-0?2 walleyes generally increased and their mean length decreased from 1980 to 2008, the trends in yellow perch abundance and length differed among the young-of-year, yearling, and age-2 age-classes. Moreover, interannual negative associations between yellow perch relative abundance and mean size are suggestive of compensatory, density-dependent control on growth, while similar evidence is lacking for walleyes. Correlation analyses indicate that walleye year-class strength is set by the fall of age 0, while the age at which recruitment is set for yellow perch is less clear and may not occur until the fall of age 1. Thus, we suggest that future studies evaluating environmental determinants of year-class strength in Saginaw Bay evaluate age-0 walleyes and age-1 yellow perch. Finally, while age-0 yellow perch and age-0 walleyes appear to respond similarly to annual environmental conditions, the recent increase in walleye abundance and decrease in the mean size of age-0 yellow perch may have contributed to the reduced abundance of adult yellow perch via walleye predation and overwinter mortality.

The time series were analysed by means of min/max auto-correlation factor analysis (MAFA) and dynamic factor analysis (DFA). The abundance of P. longirostris showed a clear increasing trend, significantly correlated with the fishing effort index (number of days at sea per month), the sea surface temperature and the wind-mixing index. The temporal variations in the stock of P. longirostris, which has a preference for warm waters, were positively correlated with the rise of the sea surface temperature and the decrease of wind circulation. For N. norvegicus, an increasing trend of landings per unit of effort and recruitment index contrasted with a decreasing trend of relative population abundance (biomass and density indices).},

   abstract = {Recruitment is highly variable in marine fishes, and is often estimated using stock-recruit relationships that explain little of the observed variability in recruitment. Researchers have sought for decades to identify environmental indices that are associated with cohort strength, and often use stock assessment estimates of recruitment within secondary regressions to test hypothesized drivers of recruitment variability. This practice is statistically questionable because it fails to acknowledge differences in the precision of recruitment estimates among species and years, as well as covariance between recruitment estimates within a given species. We developed an alternative, statistically rigorous method to estimate an index of cohort strength that is shared among several species while accounting for each single-species stock-recruit relationship. This method simultaneously optimizes multiple stock assessment models with shared cohort strength parameters, while using observation-level fishery data for each species to propagate the precision and covariance of recruitment estimates. The method is demonstrated using data for 8 groundfish species off the US West Coast for which recruitment is relatively well estimated: our model estimated high recruitment during 1990-1991 and 1999-2000, followed by anomalously low recruitment during 2002-2007. The impact of a shared index of cohort strength is demonstrated for 2 additional species with little information about recruitment, yelloweye Sebastes ruberrimus and blackgill Sebastes melanostomus rockfishes, where it decreases the coefficient of variation for recruitment estimates in the most recent modeled year by 40%. The method can be applied to other fishery management regions in the USA and elsewhere, and represents a rigorous method to estimate associations in cohort strength among species within a region. © Inter-Research 2013.},

   abstract = {Abundance indices are difficult to derive from multispecies catch-per-unit-effort (CPUE) data as these critically rely on the ability to account for targeting behaviour that directs effort towards a particular target species or species-complex. We developed a novel standardization method that uses continuous principal component scores, derived from a Principal Component Analysis of the catch composition data, as non-linear predictor variables for targeted effort within a Generalized Additive Model (GAM) framework. This 'Direct Principal Component' method (DPC) is compared to a commonly used standardization approach, in which clusters of fishing tactics are identified from the catch composition and treated as categorical variables. We employed GAMs, which incorporate spatial, seasonal, and fishing power effects, to evaluate the statistical performance of the two alternative sets of covariates. The GAMs were applied to CPUE datasets from the South African hand-line fishery, covering three fishing regions over a period of 26 years, to provide abundance indices for two commercially important species, carpenter, Argyrozona argyrozona and silver kob, Argyrosomus inodorus. Results show that both approaches removed substantial variation from the CPUE data, but that the DPC approach was statistically superior as judged by the AIC, deviance explained and results from 10-fold bootstrap cross-validations. The DPC method represents a more direct approach, is less time-consuming and subjective and therefore considerably easier to implement. We present evidence that the DPC was able to account for substantial shifts in targeting without masking the year effect. The standardized CPUE time series showed positive responses for both species as total landings decreased due to forced effort reductions in 2000. The approach presented here has potentially unlocked useful information for stock assessment in the over two million individual catch records available for the South African hand-line fishery and similar multispecies fisheries. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

   abstract = {Hawai'i network analysis Thunnus albacares yellowfin tuna Aggregations in the distribution of individuals are an almost universal phenomenon in living organisms. Groups of animals that display collective coordinated movement without forming stable social bonds such as fish schools are a special type of aggregation. In tropical tuna fisheries, aggregating behaviour is directly exploited through the use of artificial fish aggregating devices (FADs). Hence, understanding the dynamics of schooling behaviour and the potential impacts of FADs upon it may have ramifications for tuna management. As a novel way of quantifying spatiotemporal co-occurrences of animals, we applied network statistics to acoustic tracking data to identify the co-occurrences of individual yellowfin tuna, Thunnus albacares, in an array of FADs and determine the frequency and temporal dynamics of these co-occurrences. We observed large interannual variation in movement rates of tuna between FADs, and corresponding interannual variability in the mean number of spatiotemporal associates for each individual as well as the temporal stability of associations. When movement rates were high, associations within FAD aggregations decayed to randomness three times faster than when movement rates were lower. This raises the possibility that if FADs are sufficiently close for fish to perform frequent between-FAD movements, school mixing may be increased and cohesion reduced.},

   abstract = {1. Determining how animals move within their environment is a fundamental knowledge that contributes to effective management and conservation. Continuous 'round-the-clock' animal movement data are frequently gathered using biotelemetry technology, providing discrete data packages on the presence-absence of animals at known locations through time. Current analyses of such data do not generally account for the interconnectivity of locations as animals move between them and consequently do not integrate graphically or statistically a temporal component to spatial changes. 2. Here, we describe the novel application of network analyses to electronic tag data whereby nodes represent locations and edges the movements of individuals. We demonstrate some of the descriptive and quantitative approaches for determining how an animal's movement interconnects home range habitats. Telemetry data from arrays of recorders provide movement data of individual animals, and as examples of the method proposed, we examine the movements of two distinct shark species, the small-spotted catshark (Scyliorhinus canicula) and the Caribbean reef shark (Carcharhinus perezi). In doing so, we consider both local and global network properties from an animal movement perspective and simulate the effects of node disruption as a proxy for habitat disturbance. 3. Comparative visual representations of two catshark movement networks suggest, for example, potential differences in space use. Multiple regression quadratic assignment procedure shows that habitat is a significant predictor of movement behaviour. 4. Null modelling of C. perezi movement data, corrected for the spatial restriction of static nodes, demonstrated a significant, non-random distribution of directed movements among sites. Additionally, the connectivity of this animal's movement network is significantly reduced through targeted disruption of a site of high centrality but not through disruption of a randomly selected site. 5. Network theory is a well-established theoretical framework and its integration into the fast developing field of animal movement and telemetry might improve significantly how we interpret animal space use from electronically recorded data. This technique has potentially wide application in animal behaviour but may also inform the management of habitat harbouring threatened or endangered species via the simulation, modelling and intuitive visualisation of animal movement interactions.},

To date, most studies using stable isotopes as geolocators in marine settings have focussed on mammals and seabirds conducting large ocean-basin scale migrations. An increasing understanding of isotopic variation in the marine environment, and improved sampling and analytical techniques, however, means that stable isotopes now hold genuine promise as a natural geolocation tag in marine fishes. Here, the theoretical background underpinning the use of stable isotopes of C, N and O in otolith, scale and muscle tissues as geolocation tools in the marine environment is reviewed, and examples of their applications are provided.},

   abstract = {Rationale: Oxygen isotope ratios (δ 18 O values) of fish otoliths (ear bones) are valuable geochemical tracers of water conditions and thermal life history. Delta Smelt (Hypomesus transpacificus) are osmerid forage fish endemic to the San Francisco Estuary, California, USA, that are on the verge of extinction. These fish exhibit a complex life history that allows them to survive in a dynamic estuarine environment; however, a rapidly warming climate threatens this thermally sensitive species. Here we quantify the accuracy and precision of using δ 18 O values in otoliths to reconstruct the thermal life histories of Delta Smelt. Methods: Delta Smelt were reared for 360 days using three different water sources with different ambient δ 18 O water values (−8.75‰, −5.28‰, and −4.06‰) and different water temperatures (16.4°C, 16.7°C, 18.7°C, and 20.5°C). Samples were collected after 170 days (n = 28) and 360 days (n = 14) post-hatch. In situ δ 18 O values were measured from the core of the otolith to the dorsal edge using secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS) to reconstruct temporally resolved thermal life histories. Results: The δ 18 O otolith values for Delta Smelt varied as a linear inverse function of water temperature: 1000 ln α = 18.39 (±0.43, 1SE)(10 3 TK −1) − 34.56 (±1.49, 1SE) and δ 18 O otolith(VPDB) − δ 18 O water (VPDB) = 31.34(±0.09, 1SE) − 0.19(±0.01, 1SE) × T ° C. When the ambient δ 18 O water value is known, this species-specific temperature-dependent oxygen isotope fractionation model facilitated the accurate (0.25°C) and precise (±0.37°C, 2σ) reconstruction of the water temperature experienced by the fish. In contrast, the use of existing general fractionation equations resulted in inaccurate temperature reconstructions. Conclusions: The species-specific δ 18 O otolith fractionation equation allowed for accurate and precise reconstructions of water temperatures experienced by Delta Smelt. Characterization of ambient δ 18 O water values remains a critical next step for reconstructing thermal life histories of wild Delta Smelt. This tool will provide new insights into habitat utilization, potential thermal refugia, and resilience to future warming for this critically endangered fish.},

   abstract = {Rationale: Stable oxygen isotope ratios (δ 18 O values) measured in fish otoliths can provide valuable detailed information on fish life history, fish age determination, and ocean thermography. Traditionally, otoliths are sampled by micromilling followed by isotope ratio mass spectrometry (IRMS), but direct analysis by secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS) is becoming more common. However, these two methods have not been compared to determine which, if either, is better for fish age validation studies. Hence, the goals were to: (1) determine if the δ 18 O signatures from the two different methods are similar, (2) determine which method is better for fish age validation studies, and (3) examine biogeographic and migration history. Methods: Both analytical techniques, micromilling/IRMS and SIMS, were used to measure δ 18 O values in six Pacific cod (Gadus macrocephalus) otoliths. A series of measurements was made from the center of each otolith to its edge to develop a life-history δ 18 O signature for each fish. Results: The sampling resolution of SIMS analyses was 2-3 times greater than that obtained by micromilling/IRMS. We found an offset between SIMS and micromilling/IRMS δ 18 O values, about 0.5‰ on average, with SIMS yielding lower values. However, the δ 18 O patterns from both methods (i.e., the number of δ 18 O maxima) correspond to the estimated age determined by otolith growth-zone counts, validating fish age determination methods. Conclusions: Both techniques resolved δ 18 O life-history signatures and showed patterns consistent with seasonal variation in temperatures and changes due to fish migration. When otoliths are large, micromilling/IRMS can provide adequate resolution for fish age validation. However, SIMS is the better option if greater sampling resolution is required, such as when otoliths are small or specimens are longer lived and have compact growth zones.},

Additionally, mycobacteriosis, a chronic lethal bacterial disease, is currently affecting over 50% of Chesapeake Bay Striped Bass and disease-associated impacts on reproductive biology are unknown. To provide a contemporary description of Chesapeake Bay Striped Bass reproduction and examine possible effects of mycobacteriosis, we obtained reproductive data and disease prevalence information from females collected from 2002-2016. Fecundity-at-length generally agreed with published literature suggesting that fecundity has not changed over time. Prevalence of mycobacteriosis had no significant effect on fecundity, but most disease-positive fish were only mildly infected. Age at 50% maturity (2.84 years) was lower than all previous reports (range 3-7 years). It is possible that the discrepancy is due to a lack of standard methodology for staging Striped Bass oocytes or to spatiotemporal differences in maturation rates. Disease-positive fish generally matured earlier and at smaller sizes than disease-negative fish (age at 50% maturity = 2.65 and 2.94 years, respectively; length at 50% maturity = 322.21 and 342.62 mm, respectively). The results of this study reveal that the maturity ogive for Striped Bass needs to be re-evaluated throughout the species range, and that mycobacteriosis may have a negative impact on reproductive success. Future research should assess how disease severity effects reproductive biology.},

   abstract = {Ecogeochemistry-the application of geochemical techniques to fundamental questions in population and community ecology-has been used in animal migration studies in terrestrial environments for several decades; however, the approach has received far less attention in marine systems. This review includes comprehensive meta-analyses of organic zooplankton δ13C and δ15N values at the base of the food web, dissolved inorganic carbon δ13C values, and seawater δ18O values to create, for the first time, robust isoscapes for the Atlantic Ocean. These isoscapes present far greater geographic variability in multiple geochemical tracers than was previously thought, thus forming the foundation for reconstructions of habitat use and migration patterns of marine organisms. We review several additional tracers, including trace-element-to-calcium ratios and heavy element stable isotopes, to examine anadromous migrations. We highlight the value of the ecogeochemistry approach by examining case studies on three components of connectivity: dispersal and natal homing, functional connectivity, and migratory connectivity. We also discuss recent advances in compound-specific stable carbon and nitrogen isotope analyses for tracking animal movement. A better understanding of isotopic routing and fractionation factors, particularly of individual compound classes, is necessary to realize the full potential of ecogeochemistry. © 2013, by the Association for the Sciences of Limnology and Oceanography, Inc.},

The stable isotope chronologies indicated dependence on upper estuarine habitats during the early life history, and an ontogenetic shift to coastal waters at approximately 10 years of age and 140 cm total length. During the coastal phase, Atlantic Tarpon displayed among-individual variability and within-individual consistency in basal-resource dependence.

   abstract = {The majority of the world's fisheries, by number, are data-poor/limited, and there is a growing body of literature pertaining to approaches to estimate data-limited stock status. There are at least two drivers for assessing the status of data-limited fisheries. The first is to try to understand and report on the global or regional status of fisheries across many stocks. The second is to attempt to assess individual data-limited stocks, for status reporting and/or guiding management decisions. These drivers have led to attempts to find simple, generic, low-cost solutions, including the broad application of generically parameterised models, and the blanket application of a single, or limited number of possible, analytical approach(es). It is unclear that generic methods function as intended, especially when taken out of their original design context or used without care. If the intention is to resolve individual stock status for the purposes of management, there is concern with the indiscriminate application of a single method to a suite of stocks irrespective of the particular circumstances of each. We examine why caution needs to be exercised, and provide guidance on the appropriate application of data-limited assessment methods (DLMs). We recommend: (a) obtaining better data, (b) using care in acknowledging and interpreting uncertainties in the results of DLMs, (c) embedding DLMs in harvest strategies that are robust to the higher levels of uncertainty in the output of DLMs by including precautionary management measures or buffers and (d) selecting and applying DLMs appropriate to specific species' and fisheries' data and context.},

Raw cpue is seldom proportional to abundance over a whole exploitation history and an entire geographic range, because numerous factors affect catch rates. One of the most commonly applied fisheries analyses is standardization of cpue data to remove the effect of factors that bias cpue as an index of abundance. Even if cpue is standardized appropriately, the resulting index of relative abundance, in isolation, provides limited information for management advice or about the effect of fishing. In addition, cpue data generally cannot provide information needed to assess and manage communities or ecosystems. We discuss some of the problems associated with the use of cpue data and some methods to assess and provide management advice about fish populations that can help overcome these problems, including integrated stock assessment models, management strategy evaluation, and adaptive management. We also discuss the inappropriateness of using cpue data to evaluate the status of communities.

VR2 acoustic receivers were placed along the boundaries of closed areas on the east coast of Tasmania, Australia, across smaller bays within these areas, and on individual seagrass beds. Over 77 000 detection events were obtained from 46 individuals over durations of up to 129 d, demonstrating that individuals spawn over several months, traveling 100s of km within the spawning areas during this time. Squid were detected at closed area boundaries; however, most were detected again on other receivers within the closed area, indicating that although squid had moved within boundary vicinities, they had not actually left the protected area. Closures of critical spawning regions during times of heightened reproductive activity will therefore achieve the desired effect of protecting spawners and will allow for egg-laying. Clearly, inshore squid species can be highly mobile during an extended spawning phase and any assessment of the management benefits of closed areas needs to explicitly consider the temporal and spatial scales of the closed area in question. © Inter-Research 2006.},

In this study, we used fishery independent capture-based sampling to evaluate where Common Snook occurred in Tampa Bay and if it changed with spawning season, and passive acoustic telemetry to assess fine scale behavior at an inlet spawning site (2007-2009). Snook concentrated in three areas during the spawning season only one of which fell within the expected spawning habitat. Although in lower numbers, they remained in these areas throughout the winter months. Acoustically-tagged snook (n = 31) showed two seasonal patterns at the spawning site: Most fish occurred during the spawning season but several fish displayed more extended residency, supporting the capture-based findings that Common Snook exhibit facultative catadromy. Spawning site selection for iteroparous, multiple-batch spawning fishes occurs at the lifetime, annual, or intra-annual temporal scales. In this study we show colonization of a new spawning site, indicating that lifetime spawning site fidelity of Common Snook is not fixed at this fine spatial scale. However, individuals did exhibit annual and intra-seasonal spawning site fidelity to this new site over the three years studied. The number of fish at the spawning site increased in June and July (peak spawning months) and on new and full lunar phases indicating within population variability in spawning and movement patterns. Intra-seasonal patterns of detection also differed significantly with sex. Common Snook exhibited divergent migration tactics and habitat use at the annual and estuarine scales, with contingents using different overwintering habitat. Migration tactics also varied at the spawning site at the intra-seasonal scale and with sex. These results have important implications for understanding how reproductive behavior affects spatiotemporal patterns of fish abundance and their resilience to disturbance events and fishing pressure. © 2014 Lowerre-Barbieri et al.},

However, under the Magnuson-Stevens Conservation Act, the goliath grouper remains ‘overfished,’ and harvest is still illegal.

Using this data, a standard- ized index of abundance was created for juvenile goliath grouper. The index shows a substantial decline in abundance during the late 1970s and early 1980s. Since that time, the abundance of juve- niles within ENP has increased considerably, suggesting that strong year classes have recently occurred in ENP.

Communities composed of more nutritional plants (i.e., higher nutrient concentrations) lose higher percentages of production to herbivores, channel lower percentages as detritus, experience faster decomposition rates, and, as a result, store smaller carbon pools. These results suggest plant palatability as a main limiting factor of consumer metabolical and feeding rates across communities. Hence, across communities, plant nutritional quality may be regarded as a descriptor of the importance of herbivore control on plant biomass ("top-down" control), the rapidity of nutrient and energy recycling, and the magnitude of carbon storage. These results contribute to an understanding of how much and why the trophic routes of carbon flow, and their ecological implications, vary across plant communities.

A clear shift in restored reef community composition occurred 12–15 months after restoration, moving from a community dominated by opportunistic species to a more diverse and evenly distributed community, similar to that of the natural reef. Consumer stable isotope values indicated that the restored reef community was supported by similar food resources and had similar food chain length as the natural reef community by 5-month post-restoration. However, biomass-weighted isotopic diversity indices indicated that the magnitude of the main trophic pathways and characteristics of food web complexity in the restored reef did not recover to natural reef levels until 12–15 months after construction. The functional recovery of the restored reef community was driven by the homogenization of biomass distribution among trophic compartments as oysters and top predators increasingly colonized the reef. Results indicate that oyster reef restoration can support food web functions like those provided by natural reefs. We also demonstrate the importance of combining food web and community structure information in the study of ecological functioning.},

We performed statistical analysis and subdivided the bay into six zones having unique biogeochemical characteristics. Significant shifts in the drivers were identified in all the chlorophyll a time-series. Chlorophyll a concentrations closely follow global forcing and display a generalized declining trend on which seasonal oscillations are superimposed, and it is only interrupted by events of sudden increase triggered by storms which are followed by a relatively rapid return to pre-event conditions trailing again the long-term trend.},

We explored how various environmental factors affected habitat use of an ecologically and economically important tropical marine fish, bonefish (Albula vulpes), on a fringing reef flat in Culebra, Puerto Rico, using a fine-scale acoustic telemetry positioning system. Machine learning algorithms and Bayesian inference via integrated nested Laplace approximation indicated diel period was the most important predictor of bonefish habitat use; bonefish occupied seagrass and mixed bottom (seagrass, macroalgae, sand) habitats most often at night, a deep-water soft sediment lagoon during the day, and infrequently used a shallow coral rubble reef crest. Zero-truncated (presence only) positioning frequency revealed more constrained utilization distributions during daytime and periods of higher water temperatures. Bonefish occupancy was highest in seagrass and mixed bottom habitats at lower water temperatures, and declined rapidly throughout the flat above 30 °C, which is consistent with temperature-mediated physiological constraints on performance (i.e. collapse of aerobic scope). Other factors including lunar phase, tidal state, and tide height had limited influence on bonefish habitat use. Building on a body of research, we propose several drivers of bonefish habitat use patterns amongst the diverse regions and habitats occupied, including predation risk, angling pressure, tidal variations, and temperature-related physiological performance. Our results emphasise the importance of conserving important seagrass foraging habitat through management and restoration.},

   abstract = {Assessing the impacts of ongoing climate and anthropogenic-induced change on wildlife populations requires understanding species distributions and abundances across large spatial and temporal scales. For threatened or declining populations, collecting sufficient broad-scale data is challenging as sample sizes tend to be low because many such species are rare and/or elusive. As a result, demographic data are often piecemeal, leading to difficulties in determining causes of population changes and developing strategies to mitigate the effects of environmental stressors. Thus, the population dynamics of threatened species across spatio-temporal extents is typically inferred through incomplete, independent, local-scale studies. Emerging integrative modeling approaches, such as integrated population models (IPMs), combine multiple data types into a single analysis and provide a foundation for overcoming problems of sparse or fragmentary data. In this paper, we demonstrate how IPMs can be successfully implemented by synthesizing the elements, advantages, and novel insights of this modeling approach. We highlight the latest developments in IPMs that are explicitly relevant to the ecology and conservation of threatened species, including capabilities to quantify the spatial scale of management, source-sink dynamics, synchrony within metapopulations, and population density effects on demographic rates. Adoption of IPMs has led to improved detection of population declines, adaptation of targeted monitoring schemes, and refined management strategies. Continued methodological advancements of IPMs, such as incorporation of a wider set of data types (e.g., citizen science data) and coupled population-environment models, will allow for broader applicability within ecological and conservation sciences.},

   abstract = {We present a framework for evaluating the cause of fishery declines by integrating covariates into a fisheries stock assessment model. This allows the evaluation of fisheries' effects vs. natural and other human impacts. The analyses presented are based on integrating ecological science and statistics and form the basis for environmental decisionmaking advice. Hypothesis tests are described to rank hypotheses and determine the size of a multiple covariate model. We extend recent developments in integrated analysis and use novel methods to produce effect size estimates that are relevant to policy makers and include estimates of uncertainty. Results can be directly applied to evaluate trade-offs among alternative management decisions. The methods and results are also broadly applicable outside fisheries stock assessment. We show that multiple factors influence populations and that analysis of factors in isolation can be misleading. We illustrate the framework by applying it to Pacific herring of Prince William Sound, Alaska (USA). The Pacific herring stock that spawns in Prince William Sound is a stock that has collapsed, but there are several competing or alternative hypotheses to account for the initial collapse and subsequent lack of recovery. Factors failing the initial screening tests for statistical significance included indicators of the 1989 Exxon Valdez oil spill, coho salmon prédation, sea lion prédation, Pacific Decadal Oscillation, Northern Oscillation Index, and effects of containment in the herring egg-on-kelp pound fishery. The overall results indicate that the most statistically significant factors related to the lack of recovery of the herring stock involve competition or prédation by juvenile hatchery pink salmon on herring juveniles. Secondary factors identified in the analysis were poor nutrition in the winter, ocean (Gulf of Alaska) temperature in the winter, the viral hemorrhagic septicemia virus, and the pathogen Ichthyophonus hoferi. The implication of this result to fisheries management in Prince William Sound is that it may well be difficult to simultaneously increase the production of pink salmon and maintain a viable Pacific herring fishery. The impact can be extended to other commercially important fisheries, and a whole ecosystem approach may be needed to evaluate the costs and benefits of salmon hatcheries. © 2008 by the Ecological Society of America.},

   abstract = {Recent increases in emergent infectious diseases have raised concerns about the sustainability of some marine species. The complexity and expense of studying diseases in marine systems often dictate that conservation and management decisions are made without quantitative data on population-level impacts of disease. Mark-recapture is a powerful, underutilized, tool for calculating impacts of disease on population size and structure, even in the absence of etiological information. We applied logistic regression models to mark-recapture data to obtain estimates of disease-associated mortality rates in three commercially important marine species: snow crab (Chionoecetes opilio) in Newfoundland, Canada, that experience sporadic epizootics of bitter crab disease; striped bass (Morone saxatilis) in the Chesapeake Bay, USA, that experience chronic dermal and visceral mycobacteriosis; and American lobster (Homarus americanus) in the Southern New England stock, that experience chronic epizootic shell disease. All three diseases decreased survival of diseased hosts. Survival of diseased adult male crabs was 1% (0.003-0.022, 95% CI) that of uninfected crabs indicating nearly complete mortality of infected crabs in this life stage. Survival of moderately and severely diseased striped bass (which comprised 15% and 11% of the population, respectively) was 84% (70-100%, 95% CI), and 54% (42-68%, 95% CI) that of healthy striped bass. The disease-adjusted yearly natural mortality rate for striped bass was 0.29, nearly double the previously accepted value, which did not include disease. Survival of moderately and severely diseased lobsters was 30% (15-60%, 95% CI) that of healthy lobsters and survival of mildly diseased lobsters was 45% (27-75%, 95% CI) that of healthy lobsters. High disease mortality in ovigerous females may explain the poor recruitment and rapid declines observed in this population. Stock assessments should account for disease-related mortality when resource management options are evaluated.},

Generalized additive models (GAMs) were used to explore complex relationships between carangid abundance and physical oceanographic data of sea surface temperature (SST), sea surface height anomaly (SSHA) and salinity. The five most abundant carangid species collected were: Selene setapinnis (34%); Caranx crysos (30%); Caranx hippos (10%); Chloroscombrus chrysurus (9%) and Trachurus lathami (8%). Post-larval carangids (median standard length [SL] = 10 mm) were less abundant during the spring and early summer, but more abundant during the late summer and fall, suggesting summer to fall spawning for most species. Juvenile carangid (median SL = 23 mm) abundance also increased between the mid-summer and early fall. Most species showed increased abundance at lower salinities and higher temperatures, suggesting entrainment of post-larval fishes or feeding aggregations of juveniles at frontal convergence zones between the expansive river plume and dynamic mesoscale eddy water masses. However, responses were species- and life-stage specific, which may indicate fine-scale habitat partitioning between species. Ordination methods also revealed higher carangid abundances at lower salinities for both post-larval and juvenile life stages, with species- and life-stage specific responses to SST and SSHA, further suggesting habitat separation between species. Results indicate strong links between physical oceanographic features and carangid distributions in the dynamic northern GoM.},

Our major aim is to undertake a brief review of published ethnoichthyological studies with a focus on coastal Brazilian fisheries and freshwater fisheries in both Brazil and Southeast Asia. Based on such review, we provide 29 hypotheses on fish ecology based on fishermen's LEK and compare them with what is already known from the biological literature, using an arbitrary 'likelihood' measure: "Low likelihood" corresponded to unexpected hypotheses, which contradict existing biological data. "Medium likelihood" corresponded to hypotheses that could not be compared to available scientific knowledge. Hypotheses that agree with scientific data were considered as "High likelihood". We therefore discuss these three categories of hypotheses about several distinct topics, such as migration, reproduction, feeding habits, abundance patterns, ecological relationships between fish and their predators, and fishing pressure. Our results may contribute to the fisheries management and research in the studied regions and other similar places, besides raising the interest of biologists to properly include fishermen's LEK when planning and conducting fisheries surveys. © 2008 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.},

This is common in the oceans, where spatial scales of management can be mismatched with spatially dynamic metapopulations. We explore causes, consequences and potential solutions for spatial mismatches in metapopulations of an important forage fish by combining empirical analysis, numerical modeling and novel theory. We show that spatial complexity can promote stability at large scales, however ignoring complexity produces cryptic and negative consequences at small scales. Harvesting metapopulations magnifies spatial variability, which creates discrepancies between regional and local trends while increasing risk of local population collapses. Such effects asymmetrically impact locally constrained fishers and predators, which are more exposed to risks of cryptic collapses. Importantly, we show that dynamically optimizing harvest can minimize local risk without sacrificing yield. Thus, multiple nested scales of management can help avoid cryptic collapses and the ensuing ecological, social and economic consequences.},

   abstract = {Indigenous ecological knowledge and customary sea tenure may be integrated with marine and social science to conserve the bumphead parrotfish (Bolbometopon muricatum) in the Roviana Lagoon, Western Solomon Islands. Three aspects of indigenous ecological knowledge in Roviana were identified as most relevant for the management and conservation of bumphead parrotfish, and studied through a combination of marine science and anthropological methods. These were (1) local claims that fishing pressure has had a significant impact on bumphead parrotfish populations in the Roviana Lagoon; (2) the claim that only small bumphead parrotfish were ever seen or captured in the inner lagoon and that very small fish were restricted to specific shallow innerlagoon nursery regions; and (3) assertions made by local divers that bumphead parrotfish predominantly aggregated at night around the new moon period and that catches were highest at that time. The research supported claims (1) and (2), but did not support proposition (3). Although the people of the Roviana Lagoon had similar conceptions about their entitlement rights to sea space, there were marked differences among regional villages in their opinions regarding governance and actual operational rules of management in the Lagoon. Contemporary differences in management strategies resulted from people's historical and spatial patterns of settlement across the landscape and adjoining seascapes, and the attendant impact of these patterns on property relations. This was crucial in distinguishing between those villages that held secure tenure over their contiguous sea estates from those that did not. Indigenous ecological knowledge served to (1) verify that the bumphead parrotfish was a species in urgent need of protection; (2) explain how different habitats structured the size distribution of bumphead parrotfish; (3) identify sensitive locations and habitats in need of protection; and (4) explain the effect of lunar periodicity on bumphead parrotfish behaviour and catch rates. Secure customary sea tenure identified locations best suited to bumphead parrotfish management programmes, with a greater likelihood for local participation and programme success. The information was used to establish two marine protected areas in the region for bumphead parrotfish conservation.},

High climatic sensitivity and lack of significant human impact make alpine river basins important environments for examining hydrological and ecological response to global change. 2. This paper is based upon previous and ongoing research within a glacierized, alpine river system (Taillon-Gabie´ tous basin, French Pyrenees), which adopts an interdisciplinary approach to investigate the climate–hydrology–ecology cascade. Data are used to advance hypotheses concerning impacts of climate change/variability upon alpine river system hydrology and ecology. 3. The snowpacks and glaciers that are the source of Pyrenean streams are climatically sensitive, with glaciers in retreat for most of the historical period. Given anticipated changes in summer air- mass frequencies, the volume of meltwater may decrease, the nature and rate of glacier drainage may alter, and the timing of peak systems as indicators of global change, and to developing conservation strategies for these fragile ecosystems. snow- and ice-melt may shift. However, rainfall-runoff and groundwater may increase their relative contributions to stream flow. 4. The influence of changing water source contributions on physico-chemical habitat and, in turn, on benthic communities is assessed using an alternative alpine stream classification. This model predicts more rapid downstream change in benthic communities in the future as meltwater contributions decline and, at the basin-scale, biodiversity may be reduced owing to less spatio- temporal heterogeneity in water sources contributions and, thus, physico-chemical habitat. However, predictions are complicated by potential changes in biotic interactions with altered species’ distributions. 5. Integrated, long-term research into the climate–hydrology–ecology cascade in other alpine river basins is vital because interdisciplinary science is fundamental to predicting stream hydrology and ecology under scenarios of future climate/variability, to assessing the utility of alpine river},

Here we applied several data-limited stock assessments and utilized expert opinion to identify early warning signs of depletion in the rapidly growing Southern California (CA) rock crab fishery, a small scale yet economically valuable fishery being managed with relatively limited information. We chose our specific assessment methods with the aid of a decision support tool (FishPath) designed to help identify context-appropriate options for assessing and managing fisheries. Results of five assessments indicated that serial depletion, regional overfishing, and effort creep may be occurring in the rock crab fishery. Expert opinion regarding changes in fishery operations and fishing effort provided vital insights for interpreting assessment results. We illustrate a general path for enhancing understanding of fishery impacts in a data-limited fishery, and sound rationale for proactive management to address warning signs of overfishing in the southern CA rock crab fishery.},

   abstract = {Anthropogenic disturbances in coastal and marine environments have resulted in the transformation of vegetated benthic habitat spatial patterns, which is thought to influence the distribution, community composition, and behavior of marine fauna. In Biscayne Bay, Florida, USA, freshwater discharges into nearshore areas have resulted in the fragmentation of the spatial patterning of submerged aquatic vegetation (SAV). To understand the ecological consequences of the freshwater-induced SAV seascape fragmentation, fish and crustaceans were sampled using seine nets across seascapes with continuous and highly fragmented SAV spatial configurations and across salinity regimes. Fragmented SAV seascapes supported significantly higher species diversity of fish and crustaceans, especially in areas influenced by freshwater discharges. Also, fragmented seascapes supported a higher abundance of the pink shrimp Farfantepenaeus duorarum and the goby Gobiosoma robustum, and higher biomass of generalist predatory fishes than seascapes with continuous SAV. In contrast, pinfish Lagodon rhomboides was more abundant in seascapes with continuous SAV. Faunal assemblage composition differed between zones of contrasting salinity regimes, and the contribution of species occurrence and abundance to the differentiation of assemblage composition between seascape types was associated with the salinity regimes of the seascapes. Thus, water salinity and spatial properties of SAV seascapes are factors that interact to influence faunal community structure in Biscayne Bay. These findings highlight the importance of understanding how environmental context (e.g. salinity regimes) can modulate the influence of benthic spatial patterning on the abundance and biodiversity of nekton communities.},

Although these localized surveys annually sample the same populations, resulting trends in yearly indices often conflict with one another, thereby hindering interpretation of abundance patterns at broad spatial scales. We used delta-lognormal generalized linear models (GLMs) to generate indices of abundance for seven Atlantic coastal shark species from six fishery-independent surveys along the US east coast and Gulf of Mexico from 1975 to 2014. These indices were further analysed using dynamic factor analysis (DFA) to produce simplified, broad-scale common trends in relative abundance over the entire sampled distribution. Effects of drivers including the North Atlantic Oscillation index, the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation index, annually averaged sea surface temperature and species landings were evaluated within the DFA model. The two decadal oscillations and species landings were shown to affect shark distribution along south-east US coast. Estimated common trends of relative abundance for all large coastal shark species showed similar decreasing patterns into the early 1990s, periods of sustained low index values thereafter and recent indications of recovery. Small coastal shark species exhibited more regional variability in their estimated common trends, such that two common trends were required to adequately describe patterns in relative abundance throughout the Gulf of Mexico and Atlantic. Overall, all species’ (except the Gulf of Mexico blacknose shark) time series concluded with an increasing trend, suggestive of initial recovery from past exploitation.},

   abstract = {Much research has focused on identifying species that are susceptible to extinction following ecosystem fragmentation, yet even those species that persist in fragmented habitats may have fundamentally different ecological roles than conspecifics in unimpacted areas. Shifts in trophic role induced by fragmentation, especially of abundant top predators, could have transcendent impacts on food web architecture and stability, as well as ecosystem function. Here we use a novel measure of trophic niche width, based on stable isotope ratios, to assess effects of aquatic ecosystem fragmentation on trophic ecology of a resilient, dominant, top predator. We demonstrate collapse in trophic niche width of the predator in fragmented systems, a phenomenon related to significant reductions in diversity of potential prey taxa. Collapsed niche width reflects a homogenization of energy flow pathways to top predators, likely serving to destabilize remnant food webs and render apparently resilient top predators more susceptible to extinction through time. © 2007 Blackwell Publishing Ltd/CNRS.},

   abstract = {Hutchinson's n-dimensional hypervolume concept underlies many applications in contemporary ecology and evolutionary biology. Estimating hypervolumes from sampled data has been an ongoing challenge due to conceptual and computational issues. We present new algorithms for delineating the boundaries and probability density within n-dimensional hypervolumes. The methods produce smooth boundaries that can fit data either more loosely (Gaussian kernel density estimation) or more tightly (one-classification via support vector machine). Further, the algorithms can accept abundance-weighted data, and the resulting hypervolumes can be given a probabilistic interpretation and projected into geographic space. We demonstrate the properties of these methods on a large dataset that characterises the functional traits and geographic distribution of thousands of plants. The methods are available in version ≥2.0.7 of the hypervolume r package. These new algorithms provide: (i) a more robust approach for delineating the shape and density of n-dimensional hypervolumes; (ii) more efficient performance on large and high-dimensional datasets; and (iii) improved measures of functional diversity and environmental niche breadth.},

   abstract = {Habitat fragmentation involves habitat loss concomitant with changes in spatial configuration, confounding mechanistic drivers of biodiversity change associated with habitat disturbance. Studies attempting to isolate the effects of altered habitat configuration on associated communities have reported variable results. This variability may be explained in part by the fragmentation threshold hypothesis, which predicts that the effects of habitat configuration may only manifest at low levels of remnant habitat area. To separate the effects of habitat area and configuration on biodiversity, we surveyed fish communities in seagrass landscapes spanning a range of total seagrass area (2-74% cover within 16 000-m2 landscapes) and spatial configurations (1-75 discrete patches). We also measured variation in fine-scale seagrass variables, which are known to affect faunal community composition and may covary with landscape-scale features. We found that species richness decreased and the community structure shifted with increasing patch number within the landscape, but only when seagrass area was low (<25% cover). This pattern was driven by an absence of epibenthic species in low-seagrass-area, highly patchy landscapes. Additional tests corroborated that low movement rates among patches may underlie loss of vulnerable taxa. Fine-scale seagrass biomass was generally unimportant in predicting fish community composition. As such, we present empirical support for the fragmentation threshold hypothesis and we suggest that poor matrix quality and low dispersal ability for sensitive taxa in our system may explain why our results support the hypothesis, while previous empirical work has largely failed to match predictions.},

It also presents a Bayesian state-space implementation of the Schaefer production model (BSM), fitted to catch and biomass or catch-per-unit-of-effort (CPUE) data. Special emphasis was given to derive informative priors for productivity, unexploited stock size, catchability and biomass from population dynamics theory. Both models gave good predictions of the maximum intrinsic rate of population increase r, unexploited stock size k and maximum sustainable yield MSY when validated against simulated data with known parameter values. CMSY provided, in addition, reasonable predictions of relative biomass and exploitation rate. Both models were evaluated against 128 real stocks, where estimates of biomass were available from full stock assessments. BSM estimates of r, k and MSY were used as benchmarks for the respective CMSY estimates and were not significantly different in 76% of the stocks. A similar test against 28 data-limited stocks, where CPUE instead of biomass was available, showed that BSM and CMSY estimates of r, k and MSY were not significantly different in 89% of the stocks. Both CMSY and BSM combine the production model with a simple stock–recruitment model, accounting for reduced recruitment at severely depleted stock sizes.},

   abstract = {Harvest strategy approaches based around empirical indicators and/or control rules are beginning to be accepted in a growing range of data- and capacity-poor fisheries. While there is an increasing body of work around developing empirical indicators and control rules in data-poor contexts, this has typically been done on a case-specific basis. There remains a need for general guidance on formulating control rules that link empirical indicators with suitable management responses. Additionally, in the data-poor context, most literature has focused on empirical indicators and assessments, with less focus on decision rules and the incorporation of indicators and assessments in a harvest strategy framework. This review considers a range of harvest strategy options, focusing on empirical indicators and decision rules available for data-poor species and fisheries. These clearly illustrate that a paucity of information is not a reason to avoid developing harvest strategies, and that a range of pragmatic approaches are available regardless of the available data, life-history of the target species, nature of fishing operations, or the available research capacity. There is considerable scope for further work in this field, but arguably there is a comprehensive repository of approaches and decision rules that, when combined with the guidelines, form a solid foundation and toolkit for all but the most data-poor species and fisheries.},

Capture–recapture methods obtain information about detection probability p from the repeated encounters of uniquely identifiable individuals and from this derive an estimate of N. In practice, estimating N means estimating p and modeling the key patterns in p. The same concepts and methods can be used for vastly different kinds of “populations”, including populations of species, that is, communities, where size is equivalent to species richness. This chapter gives a very selective view of the large field of population size estimation, and interested readers will have to refer to the many standard references available now.},

The defining feature of a statistical model is that it accommodates the randomness and unpredictability that is the hallmark of all empirical data, even those in physics, chemistry, or molecular biology labs. It also introduces generalized linear models (GLMs); they allow distributions, other than the normal, to model the noise in a response. GLMs do so by using a link function, a transformation of the mean response that linearizes the relationship between the transformed mean response and covariates. The generalized linear model (GLM) extends the concept of a linear model from normal response models, such as analysis of variance and regression, to many other response distributions, including the Poisson and the binomial. The GLM unifies a huge number of superficially different analytical techniques, such as regression, analysis of variance, log-linear models, and logistic regression, among many others.},

Bayesian inference is based on the posterior distribution, which is a product of the likelihood (representing the information contained in the data) and the prior distribution (representing what is known about the parameters beforehand). Bayesian inference uses a fact of conditional probability, Bayes rule, to let the data update the prior state of knowledge to the posterior state of knowledge. Priors can be regarded both as an asset and as a liability in Bayesian inference. The results of a Bayesian analysis based on the posterior distribution are much more easily explained to the public owing to the more intuitive Bayesian definition of probability.

   abstract = {This chapter introduces an important class of capture-recapture models: multistate models. Multistate models are extremely flexible and can be used to address a large array of very diverse ecological questions. The flexibility stems from the fact that the definition of states can involve many different quantities, which go far beyond the classical geographic locations. Multistate capture-recapture models can be extended in exactly the same ways as the single-state models. Thus, one may model several groups, time-dependent parameters, and individual or temporal covariates, and group effects can be assumed fixed or random. The data and most parts of the BUGS model code remain the same, but there are modifications in the “Priors and constraints” part of the model. Multistate capture–recapture models some times suffer from identifiability problems, both intrinsic and extrinsic. Hence, it is important to check for identifiability, in particular when adopting less well-known multistate model variants.},

The formulation of the JS model as a restricted occupancy model has advantages of relatively fast speed and a simple model code. The super population formulation runs relatively slowly, but it is possible to directly model the entry probability and to specify a natural priority for the size of the super population.

Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-α-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 Å for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21% with default Glide SP settings to 58% with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63% success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40% of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

These indices can, however, be misleading because changes over time in catch rates can occur because of factors other than changes in abundance. Catch-effort standardization is used to attempt to remove the impact of these factors. This paper reviews the current state of the art in the methods for standardizing catch and effort data. It outlines the major estimation approaches being applied, the methods for dealing with zero observations, how to identify and select appropriate explanatory variables, and how standardized catch rate data can be used when conducting stock assessments. © 2004 Elsevier B.V.

   abstract = {Catch-and-release fisheries have become very important in the management of overexploited recreational fish stocks. Tag return studies, where the tag is removed regardless of fish disposition, have been used to assess the effectiveness of restoration efforts for these fisheries. We extend the instantaneous rate formulation of tag return models to allow for catch and release as well as harvest. The key point of our methods is that, given an estimate of the tag reporting rate, the fishing mortality rate (F) is separated into two components: the mortality on harvested fish and the "mortality" on tags (because the lags are removed) of fish released alive. The total fishing mortality rate for untagged fish is the sum of the Fs due to harvest and hooking mortality suffered by fish released alive. Natural mortality rates can also be estimated. Both age-independent models and age-dependent models are constructed, and the age-dependent models are illustrated by application to data from a study of striped bass Morone saxatilis in Chesapeake Bay from 1991 to 2003 by the Maryland Department of Natural Resources. By fi tting models of the natural mortality rate with limited age and year dependence, we demonstrate an overall decrease in natural mortality rates as fish age and provide evidence of an increase in natural mortality beginning in the late 1990s, when an outbreak of the disease mycobacteriosis is thought to have begun. Our results indicate that fishing mortality is age dependent; selectivity increases up to age 6, when fish appear to be fully recruited to the fishery. There is also evidence of an increase in fishing mortality since 1995, when regulations were relaxed. © Copyright by the American Fisheries Society 2007.},

   abstract = {The Spotted Seatrout Cynoscion nebulosus is the most popular target of recreational inshore fisheries in Mississippi coastal waters. The Gulf of Mexico (GOM) stock of Spotted Seatrout is composed of spatially distinct substocks, and each state imposes unique bag and size limits. In Mississippi, the stock is managed using minimum length limits and daily bag limits. We used two methods to evaluate the efficacy of length restrictions and fishing mortality (F) levels: (1) a per-recruit model simulation to evaluate the effects of proposed management actions on reproductive output and yield, and (2) an evaluation of how management regimes impact relative stock density (RSD). Relative stock density has been widely used as a management tool in recreational and generally freshwater fisheries but has not been widely employed in informing management of marine stocks. We used demographic information from fisheries-independent sampling and length-specific natural mortality estimates to construct both models. Our analysis suggested that decreased F, increased minimum length limits, and slot limits that include intermediate upper length limits could increase RSD measures for GOM Spotted Seatrout. We found that for all management regimes examined, local demographic properties of Spotted Seatrout may preclude large proportions of trophy-length (≥686 mm TL) individuals. Per-recruit modeling and RSD analysis are complementary approaches to inform management, as they consider spawning stock biomass, yield, and the maximization of angler satisfaction.},

   abstract = {von Bertalanffy parameters are usually estimated for a species, perhaps by sex, in some well-defined geographical area. An alternative way to estimate von Bertalanffy parameters is to model them in a general fixed-effects nonlinear model. For this model, the length of the ith individual is modeled as y i = f(φ, ti, xi) + εi, where yi is the length and ti is the age of the ith specimen at the time of sampling, φ are the unknown parameters required to model von Bertalanffy growth, and xi are covariates associated with the ith specimen that minimally contain sex information (xi1), but may also contain additional covariates. Standard nonlinear least squares and associated likelihood methods can be used to estimate parameters for this model. For Pacific ocean perch (Sebastes alutus), we model the effect that depth of collection has on estimated von Bertalanffy growth parameters; for sablefish (Anoplopoma fimbria), we model the effects due to latitude of collection; and for walleye pollock (Theragra chalcogramma) in the eastern Bering Sea, we model the effects due to variations in year classes.

The proportion of fish that migrated in spring–fall from spawning areas in Chesapeake Bay to more northern waters of mid-Atlantic and New England states was estimated from the geographically stratified tag returns. Most of the tagged fish were 40–100 cm total length (TL). The estimated proportion of migrant striped bass increased with body size, and nearly all fish larger than 100 cm TL left the bay during the spring–fall migration. Sex-specific differences in migration appear to be associated with the differences in body size of mature males and females, thus lending support to previously hypothesized patterns of striped bass migration.},

   abstract = {Temperature is hypothesized to alter disease dynamics, particularly when species are living at or near their thermal limits. When disease occurs in marine systems, this can go undetected, particularly if the disease is chronic and progresses slowly. As a result, population-level impacts of diseases can be grossly underestimated. Complex migratory patterns, stochasticity in recruitment, and data and knowledge gaps can hinder collection and analysis of data on marine diseases. New tools enabling quantification of disease impacts in marine environments include coupled biogeochemical hydrodynamic models (to hindcast key environmental data), and multievent, multistate mark–recapture (MMSMR) (to quantify the effects of environmental conditions on disease processes and assess population-level impacts). We used MMSMR to quantify disease processes and population impacts in an estuarine population of striped bass (Morone saxatilis) in Chesapeake Bay from 2005 to 2013. Our results supported the hypothesis that mycobacteriosis is chronic, progressive, and, frequently, lethal. Yearly disease incidence in fish age three and above was 89%, suggesting that this disease impacts nearly every adult striped bass. Mortality of diseased fish was high, particularly in severe cases, where it approached 80% in typical years. Severely diseased fish also had a 10-fold higher catchability than healthy fish, which could bias estimates of disease prevalence. For both healthy and diseased fish, mortality increased with the modeled average summer sea surface temperature (SST) at the mouth of the Rappahannock River; in warmer summers (average SST ≥ 29°C), a cohort is predicted to experience >90% mortality in 1 year. Regression of disease signs in mildly and moderately diseased fish was <2%. These results suggest that these fish are living at their maximum thermal tolerance and that this is driving increased disease and mortality. Management of this fishery should account for the effects of temperature and disease on impacted populations.},

   abstract = {Researchers and wildlife managers increasingly find themselves in situations where they must deal with infectious wildlife diseases such as chronic wasting disease, brucellosis, tuberculosis, and West Nile virus. Managers are often charged with designing and implementing control strategies, and researchers often seek to determine factors that influence and control the disease process. All of these activities require the ability to measure some indication of a disease's foothold in a population and evaluate factors affecting that foothold. The most common type of data available to managers and researchers is apparent prevalence data. Apparent disease prevalence, the proportion of animals in a sample that are positive for the disease, might seem like a natural measure of disease's foothold, but several properties, in particular, its dependency on age structure and the biasing effects of disease-associated mortality, make it less than ideal. In quantitative epidemiology, the "force of infection," or infection hazard, is generally the preferred parameter for measuring a disease's foothold, and it can be viewed as the most appropriate way to "adjust" apparent prevalence for age structure. The typical ecology curriculum includes little exposure to quantitative epidemiological concepts such as cumulative incidence, apparent prevalence, and the force of infection. The goal of this paper is to present these basic epidemiological concepts and resulting models in an ecological context and to illustrate how they can be applied to understand and address basic epidemiological questions. We demonstrate a practical approach to solving the heretofore intractable problem of fitting general force-of-infection models to wildlife prevalence data using a generalized regression approach. We apply the procedures to Mycobacterium bovis (bovine tuberculosis) prevalence in bison (Bison bison) in Wood Buffalo National Park, Canada, and demonstrate strong age dependency in the force of infection as well as an increased mortality hazard in positive animals. © 2006 by the Ecological Society of America.},

We compared the performances of alternative stock identification approaches, using samples taken from the same sets of fish. Reference (known) samples were collected from three Atlantic coast spawning systems: the Hudson River, Chesapeake Bay, and the Roanoke River. Striped bass of mixed-stock origin were collected from eastern Long Island, New York, and were used as test (unknown) samples. The approaches applied were discriminant analysis of morphometric data and of meristic data, logistic regression analysis of combined meristic and morphometric data, discriminant analysis of scale-shape features, discriminant analysis of immunoassay data, and mixed-stock analysis of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) data. Overall correct classification rates of reference samples ranged from 94% to 66% when just the Hudson and Chesapeake stocks were considered and were comparable when the Chesapeake and Roanoke stocks were grouped as the 'southern' stock. When all three stocks were treated independently, correct classification rates ranged from 82% to 49%. Despite the moderate range in correct classification rates, bias due to misallocation was relatively low for all methods, suggesting that resulting stock composition estimates should be fairly accurate. However, relative contribution estimates for the mixed-stock sample varied widely (e.g., from 81% to 47% for the Hudson River stock, when only the Hudson River and Chesapeake Bay stocks were considered). Discrepancies may be related to the reliance by all of these approaches (except mtDNA) on phenotypic features. Our results support future use of either a morphometrics-based approach (among the phenotypic methods) or a genotypic approach based on mtDNA analysis. We further recommend a conservative strategy of reliance on a single approach in tracking changes in relative contributions of striped bass stocks to coastal fisheries.},

   abstract = {Anadromy in Roanoke River Striped Bass Morone saxatilis has been documented; however, the specifics of the ocean migration and the degree of homing in this population remain unstudied and would greatly benefit the management of this economically important species. To this end, we telemetered and released 19 large Roanoke River Striped Bass (750–1,146 mm TL) on their spawning grounds during the springs of 2011 and 2012. Data from a large-scale acoustic telemetry array along the U.S. Atlantic coast (480 total receivers, including the Roanoke River) were used to evaluate the seasonal migration and distribution of telemetered fish, their degree of homing and skipped spawning, their migration speeds, and the environmental drivers of migration timing. We found that large Roanoke River Striped Bass (>900 mm TL) rapidly emigrated (»59 km/d) after spawning to distant (>1,000 km) northern ocean waters (New Jersey to Massachusetts), where they spent their summers. They then migrated southward in the fall to overwintering habitats off Virginia and North Carolina and completed their migration circuit the following spring by returning to the Roanoke River to spawn. Our results showed no evidence of straying or skipped spawning, as all migrants successfully returned (homed) to the Roanoke River the next spring to spawn. Cooler ocean water temperatures in 2013 delayed the spring spawning run by nearly 3 weeks relative to a year of average spring temperatures (2012). Our study provides novel information that aids the management of Striped Bass at both small (e.g., setting of fishing seasons in the Roanoke River) and large spatial scales (e.g., stock identification of Roanoke River fish in the mixed-stock ocean fishery) and more broadly highlights the utility of large-scale cooperative telemetry arrays in studying fish migration.},

Striped bass (Morone saxatilis) are long-lived, highly migratory anadromous fish recently recovered from a severe decline in population size. Previous studies with protein, nuclear DNA and mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) markers produced discordant results, and it remains uncertain if the multiple tributaries within Chesapeake Bay constitute distinct management units. Here, 196 young-of-the-year (YOY) striped bass were sampled from Maryland's Choptank, Potomac and Nanticoke Rivers and the north end of Chesapeake Bay in 1999 and from Virginia's Mataponi and Rappahannock Rivers in 2001. A total of 10 microsatellite loci exhibited between two and 27 alleles per locus with observed heterozygosities between 0.255 and 0.893. The 10-locus estimate of RST among the six tributaries was -0.0065 (95% confidence interval -0.0198 to 0.0018). All R ST and all but one θ estimates for pairs of populations were not significantly different from zero. Reanalysis of Chesapeake Bay striped bass mtDNA data from two previous studies estimated population differentiation between θ = -0.002 and 0.160, values generally similar to mtDNA population differentiation predicted from microsatellite RST after adjusting for reduced effective population size and uniparental inheritance in organelle genomes. Based on mtDNA differentiation, breeding sex ratios or gene flow may have been slightly male biased in some years. The results reconcile conflicting past studies based on different types of genetic markers, supporting a single Chesapeake Bay management unit encompassing a panmictic striped bass breedinq population. © 2005 Nature Publishing Group All rights reserved.},

   abstract = {Restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) analysis of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) was used to characterize stocks of striped bass Morone saxatilis and to estimate their relative contributions during the fall of 1989 to the mixed coastal fishery at eastern Long Island, New York. Mitochondrial DNA was obtained from reference samples of striped bass collected during the spring of 1989 from the Hudson River, New York, and four spawning areas of the Chesapeake Bay (Choptank, Rappahannock, and Potomac rivers and the upper Chesapeake Bay). Five mtDNA major length genotypes were detected in these fish, and significant differences in their frequencies were observed between the Hudson River and Chesapeake Bay samples. An mtDNA minor length genotype found in some fish (13%) from the Chesapeake Bay and absent from all Hudson River samples provided a second discriminatory character. By using a constrained generalized least squares approach, we estimated that the Hudson River and Chesapeake Bay stocks contributed 73% (95% confidence interval 50–87%) and 27% (95% confidence interval 13–51 %) respectively, of the mixed fishery sample. The probability of the Hudson River contribution exceeding the Chesapeake Bay contribution in this sample was more than 95%. These results suggest that the Hudson River contribution to the mixed coastal fishery was greater in 1989 than reported in earlier studies. We also found no differences in mtDNA major length genotype frequencies among as many as 11 year-classes within the Hudson River, Chesapeake Bay, or Roanoke River spawning systems. These results indicate that mtDNA RFLP genotypes in these striped bass stocks are temporally stable within a fisheries context.

   abstract = {Physical, chemical and perceived stressors can all evoke non-specific responses in fish, which are considered adaptive to enable the fish to cope with the disturbance and maintain its homeostatic state. If the stressor is overly severe or long-lasting to the point that the fish is not capable of regaining homeostasis, then the responses themselves may become maladaptive and threaten the fish's health and well-being. Physiological responses to stress are grouped as primary, which include endocrine changes such as in measurable levels of circulating catecholamines and corticosteroids, and secondary, which include changes in features related to metabolism, hydromineral balance, and cardiovascular, respiratory and immune functions. In some instances, the endocrine responses are directly responsible for these secondary responses resulting in changes in concentration of blood constituents, including metabolites and major ions, and, at the cellular level, the expression of heat-shock or stress proteins. Tertiary or whole-animal changes in performance, such as in growth, disease resistance and behavior, can result from the primary and secondary responses and possibly affect survivorship. Fishes display a wide variation in their physiological responses to stress, which is clearly evident in the plasma corticosteroid changes, chiefly cortisol in actinopterygian fishes, that occur following a stressful event. The characteristic elevation in circulating cortisol during the first hour after an acute disturbance can vary by more than two orders of magnitude among species and genetic history appears to account for much of this interspecific variation. An appreciation of the factors that affect the magnitude, duration and recovery of cortisol and other physiological changes caused by stress in fishes is important for proper interpretation of experimental data and design of effective biological monitoring programs.},

In parallel, sophisticated tools have been developed to process, visualize and analyse tracking data; however, many of these tools have proliferated in isolation, making it challenging for users to select the most appropriate method for the question in hand. Indeed, within the r software alone, we listed 58 packages created to deal with tracking data or ‘tracking packages’. Here, we reviewed and described each tracking package based on a workflow centred around tracking data (i.e. spatio-temporal locations (x, y, t)), broken down into three stages: pre-processing, post-processing and analysis, the latter consisting of data visualization, track description, path reconstruction, behavioural pattern identification, space use characterization, trajectory simulation and others. Supporting documentation is key to render a package accessible for users. Based on a user survey, we reviewed the quality of packages' documentation and identified 11 packages with good or excellent documentation. Links between packages were assessed through a network graph analysis. Although a large group of packages showed some degree of connectivity (either depending on functions or suggesting the use of another tracking package), one third of the packages worked in isolation, reflecting a fragmentation in the r movement-ecology programming community. Finally, we provide recommendations for users when choosing packages, and for developers to maximize the usefulness of their contribution and strengthen the links within the programming community.},

   abstract = {Complex spatial structure is the rule rather than the exception among marine populations. In addition to defining relatively large population units that are more or less reproductively independent (i.e., stocks), the process of stock identification should also strive to recognize linkages among stocks and finer-scale internal structure within them. Considerable attention has been devoted to documenting spatial patterns and exploring their ecological implications, but less attention has been paid to the full suite of complementary fishery management tools available to account for spatial patterns. We consider different aspects of the quota-setting process through which spatial structure can be addressed, including use of spatially structured stock assessment models, management strategy evaluation, and incorporation of spatial indices into harvest control rules. One common problem is that fishery management remains essentially nonspatial, even if spatial dynamics are considered in models. Conversely, there are also instances in which management is spatially explicit but with little scientific basis, which can be an opportunity for research and adaptive management. Data demands and additional uncertainties impose limitations on the application of spatially structured models and might offset the gains achieved by more detailed model specification. Therefore, we also consider complementary or alternative approaches for spatially explicit management, including distribution of catch among management areas, marine protected areas, and nested scales of governance. We conclude that a more dynamic relationship is needed among empirical researchers, modelers, and fisheries managers to identify and respond to complex spatial structure in both fisheries science and management. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.

The use of this technique in stock discrimination requires that a number of assumptions must be met, including that groups of interest possess characteristic and reproducible markers and all possible groups contributing to the group mixture have been characterized. In some instances, structural chemistry can permit observation of subtle population structure that may not be detected by genetic applications alone.

   abstract = {Establishing links between migration patterns and trophic dynamics is paramount to ecological studies investigating the functional role habitats provide to resident and transient species. Natural tags in fishes, such as otolith chemistry and tissue stable isotopes, can help reconstruct previous environmental and dietary histories, although these approaches are rarely combined. A novel multiproxy natural tag approach was developed to estimate immigration patterns of juvenile Atlantic croaker Micropogonias undulatus, across contrasting salinity gradients in three subtropical estuaries of the western Gulf of Mexico. Juvenile young-of-year Atlantic croaker were collected along a latitudinal gradient that included positive, neutral, and negative estuaries, based on physicochemical (temperature, salinity, dissolved element) and isotopic (δ15N and δ13C) parameters. Otolith elemental chronologies of Sr/Ca and Ba/Ca were used to classify migratory types within each estuary, while tissue-specific isotope ratios revealed time since recent (liver~weeks) and longer term (muscle~months) diet shifts. Nitrogen isotopes in both liver and muscle tissues were highly correlated, suggesting tissue equilibrium and estuarine residence of at least 3 months, with geographic δ15N gradients reflecting the magnitude of anthropogenic nutrient enrichment within each estuary. Differences in isotopic equilibrium of muscle-liver δ13C values and variation in marginal edge otolith Sr/Ca and Ba/Ca suggested recent shifts in carbon source and habitat utilization, reflecting individualized movement across seascapes and connectivity of habitat mosaics. The multiproxy approach presented here identified diverse migration patterns and linked feeding and movement on regional (inter-estuary), local (intra-estuary), and individual scales to improve our understanding of habitat function across estuarine gradients.},

Muscle stable isotopes exhibited a spatial change from inshore to offshore habitats associated with growth, possibly related to the reef-ward movement of the fish. Otolith stable isotopes of adult fish from CARs were measured in juvenile (from outside the core to the first opaque zone of otolith) and adult (the edge of otolith) portions and were compared with those of juveniles from Setiu Lagoon, suggesting that the adult fish may not primarily use the lagoon as a nursery before ontogenetically migrating to CARs. The effects of coastal currents between monsoonal seasons could reorientate offshore juvenile migration; hence, adult cohorts in CARs may be replenished from various nursery habitats along the coast. Additionally, similarities in the δ18Ootolith values of juvenile and adult sections suggested that some individuals may not spend their juvenile phases in shallow estuarine habitats. Based on the findings of this study, we recommend that coastal conservation strategies take into account multiple nursery habitats rather than a single one.},

Both species occurred in similar water temperatures; however, A. goreensis juveniles occupied habitats characterized by greater wave-driven flow velocities and closer proximity to coral reefs than A. vulpes. Likewise, A. goreensis was present across a broader range of flow environments and sampling stations than A. vulpes, which was typically confined to sheltered, low-flow habitats. The results of stable isotope analyses were consistent with the species’ relationships with environmental parameters, providing support for differential habitat and/or resource utilization. Otolith δ 18 O did not differ significantly between species, suggesting they experience comparable thermal regimes. However, δ 13 C varied substantially, with the otoliths of A. goreensis depleted in 13 C relative to A. vulpes by approximately 1‰, potentially signifying a greater reliance on pelagic carbon sources by the former, in agreement with observed distinctions in habitat use. In linear models, otolith δ 13 C was negatively correlated with ambient flow velocity and positively related to distance from coral reef habitats, and these relationships did not vary across species. After accounting for the effects of these variables, species-specific differences in otolith δ 13 C remained, indicating that other unknown factors contributed to the observed disparities. Collectively, our findings suggest that niche partitioning between A. goreensis and A. vulpes is likely mediated by their differential abilities to compete across various flow environments, likely as a result of divergent behavioral and/or physiological adaptation.},

To evaluate whether these three MUs correspond to separate demographic units (DUs), as well as to estimate mixing rates and spatial distribution of these DUs, we combined three types of otolith natural markers: isotopic signatures (δ13C and δ18O), elemental compositions (Na, Mg, Mn, Sr and Ba) and microstructural indexes. All otolith markers were determined in nuclear and marginal regions of juveniles and adults from cohorts 2012 and 2015. Differences in core region markers indicated spatial segregation between three environmentally distinct nursery areas, probably related to Subtropical Water (MU-I), Subantarctic Water (MU-III) and the Subtropical Convergence (MU-II). Comparison of core and marginal regions, from juvenile and/or adult fish, suggested that adult fish remained nearby nursery areas, separated from fish nursed in other MUs. Nonetheless, ontogenetic migrations from warmer (offshore) nursery habitats to cooler (deeper/more coastal) feeding habitats occurred within MUs. In summary, our results support the consideration of the three MUs as three separate DUs. Estimated mixing rates indicated MU-II received contributions of 31% from MU-I and 3% from MU-III, while complete segregation existed between MU-I and MU-III. Such mixing rates between MU-I and MU-III seem large enough to justify its further consideration by stock assessment models and management procedures.},

Increasing numbers of traditional fish traps, recreational fishing effort and unknown extents of illegal gillnetting are blamed for the declining abundance of estuarine-dependent fish species in the Kosi Bay estuarine lake system in KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa. Otoliths from four important fishery species (Lutjanus argentimaculatus, Pomadasys commersonnii, Acanthopagrus vagus, and Rhabdosargus sarba) and water samples collected from throughout the Kosi Bay system were analyzed for trace element constituents and δ 18O values, in an attempt to reconstruct fish movements. The applied microscopic X-ray fluorescence analysis proved valuable in detecting μm-scale spatially resolved Sr/Ca ratio distributions across otolith thin sections. Sr/Ca ratios and δ 18O in otoliths correlated well with ambient water conditions and, thus, enabled us to reconstruct migratory histories of individual fish in the estuarine lake system. The findings are representative of the known biology of these species, although exact spatial and temporal ranges of migrations remain unclear. Interestingly, samples of two species (L. argentimaculatus and R. sarba) did not show any clue of migrations back to sea, which would be necessary for successful spawning. Further laboratory and field investigations with larger sample sizes are necessary to detect fishery impacts on migratory behavior at a population level. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

High-precision micromilling and microvolume carbonate analysing systems had the remarkable capability of extracting the otolith δ18O profiles with 10–30 days resolution. Furthermore, reasonable movements were reproduced by searching the routes consistent with the otolith δ18O profile, using an individual-based model with random swimming behaviour.

   abstract = {Migratory animals pose difficult challenges to conservation and management because identifying critical habitats used throughout their lives is rarely possible. Endogenous tracers (e.g. isotope ratios) recorded in sequentially growing biogenic tissues, however, represent a potential source of unique insights at the more elusive temporal and spatial scales central to understanding the ecology of mobile species. To this end, a general probabilistic framework has emerged that quantitatively compares predictive models of isotopic variation across landscapes (called isoscapes) to the isotopic composition recorded in a biological tissue to determine the provenance and movements of animals throughout their lives. Although this spatially continuous approach to isotope-based geographic assignment is becoming more common across taxa and ecosystems, adopting this framework to take advantage of serial isotope records stored within sequentially growing biogenic tissues (e.g. teeth or otoliths) is less common. Here, we construct a novel space-time isotope model of provenance (STIMP) that determines the habitat use through time of migratory fish across river basins. To do so, this model integrates: strontium isotope (87Sr/86Sr) ratios across a riverscape, the serial records of 87Sr/86Sr within otoliths, habitat geomorphology and the directional movement patterns of fish through river networks. To illustrate an application of the model, we applied it to a published dataset from Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) harvested in 2011 during a coastal fishery in Bristol Bay, Alaska, U.S.A. Using this model, we show how individuals exploit an array of habitat types to achieve their juvenile growth prior to ocean migration, and that the intensity of habitat use among habitat types across the basin shifts spatially over the course of freshwater residence (e.g. from headwaters to migration corridors). The STIMP presented here integrates diverse information sources to reveal the cryptic juvenile movement patterns of a highly migratory species, providing new insights critical to their conservation. This general framework is applicable to any migratory taxa that use isotopically heterogeneous landscapes during their lives and record such variation in sequentially growing biogenic tissues.},

Here, two mixture methods were applied to natural chemical markers (δ18O and δ13C) in otoliths (ear stones) to comprehensively investigate the nature and degree of transoceanic movement and mixing of eastern and western populations in several areas of the North Atlantic Ocean that potentially represent mixing hotspots. Areas investigated occurred on both sides of the 45°W management boundary as well as waters off the coast of Africa (Morocco, Canary Islands) where both populations are known to occur. Projections of population composition (i.e., natal or nursery origin) from a multinomial logistic regression (MLR) classification method with different probability thresholds were generally in agreement with maximum likelihood estimates from the commonly used mixed-population program HISEA; however, predicted contributions for the less abundant population were occasionally higher for MLR estimates. Both MLR and HISEA clearly showed that mixing of Atlantic bluefin tuna in the Central North Atlantic Ocean was highly variable from year to year with expatriates of eastern or western origin commonly crossing into the other management area. Pronounced transoceanic movement and mixing of western migrants was also present off the coast of Africa, with the occurrence of western migrants in the Canary Islands and Morocco ranging from zero to the majority of the individuals assayed for the years examined. Results indicate highly variable rates of movement and population exchange for Atlantic bluefin tuna, highlighting the need for temporally resolved estimates of natal origin in mixing hotspots to improve population models used to evaluate the status of this threatened species.},

   abstract = {The northern stock of Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua) once supported one of the world's largest fisheries, but since the early 1990s has been in a collapsed and post-industrial state. Extreme life history trait changes have occurred in this stock, most evident in early maturation and increased fecundity and mortality. Using historical data from the early 1960s (pre-industrial) and previously unpublished data from 1999 and 2003 (post-industrial), we show co-variation of these traits. Few fish in the later period reached 6 years of age or >60 cm (formerly many reached >12 years and >80 cm), but fecundity at size in the early maturing fish was higher than ever recorded in any cod stock. Post-industrial cod at 4 years had a potential fecundity of about 0.5 million eggs, which did not occur until age 6 in pre-industrial times. Coincidentally, mortality was low during the pre-industrial period but increased dramatically in the post-industrial period. Using an egg-per-recruit model, fit to age and length structure data from the two periods, we also show how reduced survivorship, earlier age at maturity and increased fecundity resulted in a compensated fecundity per recruit that was >75% of pre-industrial levels. The cause of these changes, whether they represent traits selected for by the fishery, responses to reduced densities, or a combination of these factors is discussed, but remains uncertain. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

   abstract = {We develop a per-recruit model for the management of the California market squid (Loligo opalescens) fishery. Based on recent confirmation of determinate fecundity in this species, we describe how catch fecundity (i.e., eggs remaining in the reproductive tracts of harvested females) can be used to simultaneously infer fishing mortality rate along with management reference points such as yield-per-recruit, spawned eggs-per-recruit, and proportional egg escapement. Rates of mortality and egg laying have important effects on these reference points. Somewhat surprisingly, increasing the rate of natural mortality decreased spawned eggs-per-recruit while increasing proportional egg escapement. Increasing the rate of egg laying increased both spawned eggs-per-recruit and egg escapement. Other parameters, such as the maturation rate and gear vulnerability of immature females, affected the reference points. In actual practice, the influence of these parameters for immature squid may go undetected if immature squid are excluded from analysis of the catch. Application of this model to routine management is feasible but requires refinement of sampling procedures, biological assumptions, and model parameters. This model is useful because it is grounded on empirical data collected relatively inexpensively from catch samples (catch fecundity) while allowing for the simultaneous calculation of instantaneous fishing mortality rate and egg escapement. © 2005 NRC.},

The American lobster (Homarus americanus) supports Canada’s most valuable fishery and exploitation rates are high. Female size-at-maturity (SM) is an important parameter in management of this species, as it is used in establishing minimum legal size regulations. In this study, we show with historical and recent data that SM of female American lobsters has declined across most of Canada, in some areas by as much as 30%, over the past 10–80 years. The spatial patterns of these declines are inconsistent with patterns of rising ocean temperature and lobster abundance (density). They are, however, strongly correlated to the strength of size-based fishery selection, and egg-per-recruit modeling indicates a gain in lifetime egg production associated with observed SM declines under a range of realistic harvesting scenarios. These findings suggest that the marked decrease we document in SM of female American lobsters in Canada over the past century represents an evolutionary response to intense exploitation.},

Populations at both extremes of its distribution are largely resident while those in the center of its range (Hudson River, New York, to Roanoke River, North Carolina) are seasonally migratory, ranging from the Bay of Fundy, Canada, to the Outer Banks of North Carolina. Historically, population abundances of striped bass fluctuated widely, sometimes resulting in the imposition of severe management measures to restrict their harvest. Detailed knowledge of its rangewide population structure would aid in more effective management; however, most genetic studies addressing the structure of the migratory coastal stock have largely failed to achieve this goal. To address this need, we used multi-loci microsatellite DNA analysis. We identified six, and posibly one more, genetically distinct populations across the species’ distribution, including the Miramichi, Shubenacadie, Hudson, Delaware-Chesapeake, Roanoke, and Santee-Cooper rivers. We also report significant genetic differentiation between the Nanticoke and Choptank rivers along the eastern shore of the Chesapeake Bay and collections from tributaries along the western shore of the Bay. The Annapolis and Saint John rivers, tributaries of the Bay of Fundy, historically hosted striped bass aggregations that were extirpated, or nearly so, by anthropogenic stressors in the late 20th century. No specimens with unique genotypes were found in collections from either river; instead the vast majority were admixed with genotypes of Shubenacadie River, Hudson River, Chesapeake Bay, and Roanoke River lineages. Finally, we show in simulations that these genetic markers should be informative in quantifying the contributions of the Hudson River, Chesapeake Bay-Delaware, and Roanoke River to mixed-stock harvests that occur within the range of the coastal migratory stock.},

   abstract = {Understanding spatial structure and identifying subpopulations are critical for estimating population growth rates and extinction risk, and as such essential for effective conservation planning. However, movement and spatiotemporal environmental data are often unavailable, limiting our ability to directly define subpopulations and their level of asynchrony. This study applies a recently developed statistical technique using time-series analysis of abundance data to identify subpopulations. The approach uses multivariate state-space models and Akaike's Information Criterion-based model selection to quantify the data support for different subpopulation numbers and configurations. This technique is applied to the population of California sea lions Zalophus californianus in the Gulf of California, Mexico, distributed across 13 breeding sites. The abundance of California sea lions in the Gulf of California has declined over the last decade, though not all areas have been equally affected. In light of this variation, it is important to understand the population structure to ensure accurate viability assessments and effective management. Our data support the hypothesis that the Gulf of California sea lion population has four subpopulations, each with 2-5 breeding sites. The dynamics between several adjacent subpopulations were correlated, suggesting that they experience similar environmental variation. For each subpopulation, we estimated long-term growth rates, as well as the environmental and observation variation. For most of the subpopulations, our estimates of growth rates were considerably lower than those previously reported. In addition, we found considerable variability across subpopulations in their projected risk of severe decline over the next 50 years. Synthesis and applications. We illustrate a new multivariate state-space modelling technique that uses time series of abundance to quantify the data support for different subpopulation configurations. Our analysis of the California sea lion population in the Gulf of California indicates that the population is spatially structured into four subpopulations, each exhibiting distinct risks of extinction. Based on our results, we recommend that conservation and management efforts in the Gulf of California focus on the two subpopulations with high probabilities of extinction within the next 50 years (Northern Midriff, Southern Midriff). Multivariate state-space models provide a practical approach to determine the spatial structure of virtually any species; they may be particularly useful for species of conservation concern for which data on dispersal and environmental drivers are likely to be scarce. © 2009 The Authors.

   abstract = {We used micro-milling methods to reconstruct individual lifetime stable carbon isotope (δ13C) records from otoliths of Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua) collected off eastern Newfoundland, Canada (NAFO Divisions 3KL and 3O) over a period of several decades. Overall lifetime trends of otolith δ13C were similar among individuals and typically showed an increase of approximately 1.5-2‰ during the first several (3-4) years followed by a more stable "adult" portion with maximum values between -1 and 0‰. These trends are consistent with those reported for cod elsewhere in Atlantic Canada and from the northeast Atlantic and, based on results herein, have persisted for about 50 years among cod off eastern Newfoundland. Despite this general consistency, our study gives evidence of geographic differences which may reflect different stock components within northern (3KL) cod based on characteristic patterns of δ 13Coto. Notably, cod living in very deep water off the edge of the shelf appear to have distinctly lower δ13C oto patterns related to the lower δ13CDIC of these deep waters. Our results also suggest that there are differences in the feeding behaviour among juvenile cod from different regions. Seasonal variations in δ13Coto were noticeable among juvenile cod, but not among adults. There appeared to be an abrupt shift towards lower δ13Coto values in cod spawned during the mid-1980s and sampled in Div. 3KL. A downward shift in δ13C of otoliths of mature cod was previously reported among cod on the Scotian Shelf, and may be related to migration of the fish to deeper waters. Further information on the isotopic composition of potential prey as well as DIC at varying water depths in this region will be necessary to better interpret these changes in δ13Coto. © 2004 Elsevier B.V.

Historically, S. fasciatus and S. mentella have been managed together as a single stock because of similar biology and difficulty in species identification. Here we use multivariate autoregressive state-space models to examine the abundance trajectories of the three species and to determine whether they can be treated as a single stock for management purposes or whether they should be treaty separately. We also included covariates to evaluate relationships with climate, commercial catch, and the abundance of predators and (or) competitors and prey. We did two separate analyses: (i) a single-period analysis over the full time series and (ii) a blocked, two-period analysis over different regulatory periods. In both analyses, the best-fit model included separate trajectories for each species at each depth but one overall stock growth rate; both also included commercial catches as a covariate.

   abstract = {Ecosystem-based fisheries management requires data on all parts of the ecosystem, and this can be a barrier in data-poor systems. Marine ecologists need a means of drawing together diverse information to reconstruct species abundance trends for a variety of purposes. This article uses a fuzzy logic approach to integrate information from multiple data sources and describe biomass trends for marine species groups in the northern Gulf of California, Mexico. Forty-two species groups were analyzed, comprising fish, invertebrates, birds, mammals, turtles, and algae. The most important new data series comes from recent interviews with fishers in the northern part of the gulf. Respondents were asked to classify the abundance of various targeted and untargeted marine species groups from 1950 to the present. The fuzzy logic method integrates their responses with catch-per-unit-effort series, intrinsic vulnerability to fishing determined from life history parameters, biomass predicted by a Schaefer harvest model, and other simple indices. The output of the fuzzy logic routine is a time series of abundance for each species group that can be compared with known trends. The results suggest a general decline in species abundance across fished and unfished taxa, with a few exceptions. Information gathered from interviews indicated that older fishers tended to recognize a greater relative decrease in species abundance since 1970 than did younger fishers, providing another example of Pauly's (1995) shifting cognitive baselines. © American Fisheries Society 2011.},

   abstract = {Assessing the spatial structure of abundance of a species is a basic requirement to carry out adequate conservation strategies. However, existing attempts to predict species abundance, particularly in absolute units and on large scales, are scarce and have led to weak results. In this work we present a scheme to obtain, in an affordable way, a predictive model of absolute animal abundance on large scales based on the modelling of data obtained from local ecological knowledge (LEK) and its calibration. To exemplify this scheme, we build and validate a predictive absolute abundance model of the endangered terrestrial tortoise Testudo graeca in Southeast Iberian Peninsula. For that purpose, we collected distribution and relative abundance data of T. graeca using a low cost methodology, such as LEK, by means of interviewing shepherds. The information from LEK was employed to build a predictive habitat-based model of relative abundance. The relative abundance model was transformed into an absolute abundance model by means of calibration with a classical absolute abundance sampling method such as distance sampling. The obtained absolute abundance model predicted the observed absolute abundances values well in independent locations when compared with other works (R2 = 36%) and thus can offer a cost-effective predictive ability. Our results show that reliable habitat-based predictive maps of absolute species abundance on regional scales can be obtained starting from low cost sampling methods of relative abundance, such as LEK, and its calibration. © Springer Science+Business Media B.V. 2009.},

Fishing for fun is commonly considered a low-impact pastime, and anglers are heralded as conservationists, despite evidence that recreational fishing has substantially reduced populations of vulnerable nearshore fish. This essay explores the role of anglers in the decline and conservation of marine fish populations by examining the history of sportfishing in the Florida Keys. Both recreational and commercial fishers contributed to overfishing in Florida over the last century through direct extraction of fish, but recreational anglers drove declines by propagating a myth that abundant fish persist that everyone deserves a chance to catch. In the last two decades, marine angling groups have created a "Right to Fish" movement that supports legislation to protect their perceived fishing rights. The movement has obstructed effective conservation policy and encouraged continuing pressure on an exhausted reef ecosystem. Such political activism among marine anglers stands in stark contrast to the tradition of conservationminded sportsmen, who have supported habitat protection and areas closed as reserves on land and in freshwater. As attention to marine environmental history grows, marine recreational fisheries should continue to provide abundant material for analysis of the relationship between conservation and sport, as well as among tourism, economic decline, and environmental change. © 2012 The Author.},

   abstract = {Many of the world's most vulnerable and rapidly changing ecosystems are also among the most data-poor, leading to an increased interest in use of local ecological knowledge (LEK) to document long-term environmental change. The integration of multiple knowledge sources for assessing species abundance and distribution has gained traction over the past decade as a growing number of case studies show concordance between LEK and scientific data. This study advances the use of quantitative approaches for synthesizing LEK by presenting a novel application of bootstrapping and statistical modeling to evaluate variance in ecological observations of fisheries practitioners. We developed an historical record of abundance for 22 marine species in Puget Sound, Washington (USA), using LEK, and we quantified variation in perceptions of abundance trends among fishers, divers, and researchers. These individuals differed in aspects of their information environments, which are characterized by how, when, and where an individual has acquired ecological information. Abundance trends derived from interviews suggest that populations of long-lived rockfishes (Sebastes spp.) have been in decline since at least the 1960s and that three rockfishes protected under the Endangered Species Act were perceived as relatively less abundant than other species. Differences in perception of rockfish abundance trends among age groups were consistent with our hypothesis that the reported magnitude of decline in abundance would increase with age, with younger respondents more likely to report high abundance than older individuals across all periods. Temporal patterns in the mean and variance of reported rockfish abundance indices were qualitatively similar between fishers and researchers; however, fishers reported higher indices of abundance than researchers for all but one rockfish species. The two respondent groups reported similar changes in rockfish abundance from the 1940s to 2000s, except for two recreationally valuable species that fishers perceived as having undergone greater declines than perceived by researchers. When aggregated at appropriate spatial-temporal scales and in a culturally appropriate manner, observations of resource users are a valuable source of ecological information. Continued development of creative analytical tools for synthesizing multiple knowledge sources will be essential for advancing the formal use of LEK in assessments of marine species. © 2014 by the Ecological Society of America.},

   abstract = {Traditional ecological knowledge (TEK) represents multiple bodies of knowledge accumulated through many generations of close interactions between people and the natural world. TEK and its application via customary ecological management plans can be useful in modern conservation programs. I disaggregate the term TEK into its constituent parts and show several ways in which TEK can strengthen research designs by increasing locality-specific knowledge, including environmental linkages occurring in those localities. Examples of the uses of TEK in conservation include folk taxonomy in systematics in Micronesia, species knowledge for conservation in Kiribati, and fishers' knowledge of ecological interactions for reserve design in Belize. When conservationists recognize the utility of TEK, they can engage in an equitable exchange of knowledge and foster shared responsibility with indigenous people. These types of exchanges can also provide an opportunity for indigenous people to develop a scientific infrastructure. ©2005 Society for Conservation Biology.},

   abstract = {The effect of variability in targeting needs to be removed from catch-per-unit-effort (CPUE) data to estimate reliable abundance indices for multispecies fisheries. We test a Generalized Additive Model (GAM) that includes principal component scores (PCs) derived from the species composition in the catch, called the 'Direct Principal Component' (DPC) procedure, for its ability to remove the effect of variable targeting. Biomass trends are simulated for two multispecies, multi-habitat fishery scenarios: (i) four species distributed differentially across two habitats and (ii) ten species distributed differentially across four habitats. Tweedie distributed CPUE records are generated from the biomass trends for a fishery with constant targeting (control scenarios) and time-varying targeting (test scenarios). The DPC procedure is simulation-tested for its ability to estimate the underlying biomass trends for all species relative to the non-standardized CPUE index. The DPC procedure proved to be more accurate compared to nominal CPUE trends in the test scenarios. Even in the control scenarios, the DPC procedure offers greater accuracy for the estimated year effect by removing substantial variation from the data, with a small penalty on the accuracy of the underlying abundance trend. However, caution is advised if the DPC-derived index diverges noticeably from alternative models despite no indications for shifts in targeting. A selection procedure based on eigenvalues of the PCs is suitable to identifying the best-performing number of PCs to include in the GAM. The DPC procedure should be applicable for a variety of multispecies fisheries. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

   abstract = {Recreational fisheries in the waters off the northeast U.S. target a variety of pelagic and demersal fish species, and catch and effort data sampled from recreational fisheries are a critical component of the information used in resource evaluation and management. Standardized indices of stock abundance developed from recreational fishery catch rates are routinely used in stock assessments. The statistical properties of both simulated and empirical recreational fishery catch-rate data such as those collected by the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) Marine Recreational Fishery Statistics Survey (MRFSS) are examined, and the potential effects of different assumptions about the error structure of the catch-rate frequency distributions in computing indices of stock abundance are evaluated. Recreational fishery catch distributions sampled by the MRFSS are highly contagious and overdispersed in relation to the normal distribution and are generally best characterized by the Poisson or negative binomial distributions. The modeling of both the simulated and empirical MRFSS catch rates indicates that one may draw erroneous conclusions about stock trends by assuming the wrong error distribution in procedures used to developed standardized indices of stock abundance. The results demonstrate the importance of considering not only the overall model fit and significance of classification effects, but also the pos-sible effects of model misspecification, when determining the most appropriate model construction.},

   abstract = {Abundance indices are difficult to derive from multispecies catch-per-unit-effort (CPUE) data as these critically rely on the ability to account for targeting behaviour that directs effort towards a particular target species or species-complex. We developed a novel standardization method that uses continuous principal component scores, derived from a Principal Component Analysis of the catch composition data, as non-linear predictor variables for targeted effort within a Generalized Additive Model (GAM) framework. This 'Direct Principal Component' method (DPC) is compared to a commonly used standardization approach, in which clusters of fishing tactics are identified from the catch composition and treated as categorical variables. We employed GAMs, which incorporate spatial, seasonal, and fishing power effects, to evaluate the statistical performance of the two alternative sets of covariates. The GAMs were applied to CPUE datasets from the South African hand-line fishery, covering three fishing regions over a period of 26 years, to provide abundance indices for two commercially important species, carpenter, Argyrozona argyrozona and silver kob, Argyrosomus inodorus. Results show that both approaches removed substantial variation from the CPUE data, but that the DPC approach was statistically superior as judged by the AIC, deviance explained and results from 10-fold bootstrap cross-validations. The DPC method represents a more direct approach, is less time-consuming and subjective and therefore considerably easier to implement. We present evidence that the DPC was able to account for substantial shifts in targeting without masking the year effect. The standardized CPUE time series showed positive responses for both species as total landings decreased due to forced effort reductions in 2000. The approach presented here has potentially unlocked useful information for stock assessment in the over two million individual catch records available for the South African hand-line fishery and similar multispecies fisheries. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

The approach is based on three concepts: 1) composition data that are used to determine the component of the population represented by the index should be weighted by CPUE (abundance) while the composition data used to represent the fish removed from the stock should be weighted by catch; 2) due to spatial non-randomness in fishing effort and fish distribution, the index, index composition, and catch composition, should be calculated at a fine spatial scale (e.g., 1°x1°) and summed using area weighting; and 3) fine-scale spatial stratification will likely result in under-sampled and unsampled cells and some form of smoothing method needs to be applied to inform these cells. We illustrate the concepts by applying them to yellowfin tuna (Thunnus albacares) in the eastern Pacific Ocean.},

   abstract = {Local and traditional ecological knowledge (LTK) is increasingly recognized as an important component of scientific research, conservation, and resource management. Especially where there are gaps in the scientific literature, LTK can be a critical source of basic environmental data; this situation is particularly apparent in the case of marine ecosystems, about which comparatively less is known than terrestrial ones. We surveyed the global literature relating to the LTK of marine environments and analyzed what knowledge has been collected and with what aims and results. A large proportion of LTK which has been documented by researchers consists of species-specific information that is important for traditional resource use. However, knowledge relating to marine ecology, environmental change, and contemporary resource management practices is increasingly emphasized in the literature. Today, marine LTK is being used to provide historical and contemporary baseline information, suggest stewardship techniques, improve conservation planning and practice, and to resolve management disputes. Still, comparatively few studies are geared toward the practicalities of developing a truly collaborative, adaptive, and resilient management infrastructure that is embracive of modern science and LTK and practices in marine environments. Based on the literature, we thus suggest how such an infrastructure might be advanced through collaborative projects and bridging institutions that highlight the importance of trust-building and the involvement of communities in all stages of research, and the importance of shared interest in project objectives, settings (seascapes), and outcomes. © 2012 by the author(s).},

   abstract = {Animal movement comes in a variety of 'types' including small foraging movements, larger one-way dispersive movements, seasonally-predictable round-trip migratory movements, and erratic nomadic movements. Although most individuals move at some point throughout their lives, movement patterns can vary widely across individuals within the same species: differing within an individual over time (intra-individual), among individuals in the same population (inter-individual), or among populations (inter-population). Yet, studies of movement (theoretical and empirical alike) more often focus on understanding 'typical' movement patterns than understanding variation in movement. Here, I synthesize current knowledge of movement variation (drawing parallels across species and movement types), describing the causes (what factors contribute to individual variation), patterns (what movement variation looks like), consequences (why variation matters), maintenance (why variation persists), implications (for management and conservation), and finally gaps (what pieces we are currently missing). By synthesizing across scales of variation, I span across work on plasticity, personality, and geographic variation. Individual movement can be driven by factors that act at the individual, population, community and ecosystem level and have ramifications at each of these levels. Generally the consequences of movement are less well understood than the causes, in part because the effects of movement variation are often nested, with variation manifesting at the population level, which in turn affects communities and ecosystems. Understanding both cause and consequence is particularly important for predicting when variation begets variation in a positive feedback loop, versus when a negative feedback causes variation to be dampened successively. Finally, maintaining standing variation in movement may be important for facilitating species' ability to respond to future environmental change.},

   abstract = {The highly migratory Atlantic bluefin tuna (Thunnus thynnus) has a distribution that spans the North Atlantic and two distinct spawning populations, an eastern population originating in the Mediterranean Sea and a western population originating in the Gulf of Mexico. Atlantic bluefin tuna are managed as two separate management units (east and west) in the North Atlantic, despite observed mixing that occurs across the management boundary. Characterizing the effects of stock mixing has been identified as a priority for improving the management of Atlantic bluefin tuna. Identifying the stock composition of landings from the Gulf of Maine is of particular importance, because approximately 70 % of the U.S. western Atlantic total allowable catch is removed from this region annually. The aim of our research was to apply otolith chemistry techniques to characterize the origin of bluefin tuna caught in the U.S. rod and reel fishery in the Gulf of Maine and to demonstrate how this information can be applied in fisheries management. Prior research established otolith stable isotope chemistry (δ13C and δ18O) as an effective and reliable stock identification tool, and we applied this approach to determine the population of origin of bluefin tuna collected from fishery dependent sampling (recreational and commercial) in the Gulf of Maine. Results indicated that the majority of fish caught in the Gulf of Maine from 2010 to 2013 were eastern origin. We found the highest proportion of eastern origin fish were caught in 2012 and the proportion of eastern origin fish was greater in late summer to fall. Although the majority of fish in small and intermediate size classes were eastern origin, fish in the largest size class (>250 cm) were predominantly western origin. Using these data, we demonstrated an approach for integrating mixed stock composition information into fishery-specific harvest data (U.S. rod and reel catch, catch-at-age, and catch-per-unit-effort). This information can be used to monitor mixed stock composition of the fishery, partition catch to population of origin, and to inform management decisions aimed at controlling population of origin harvest.},

   abstract = {Rationale: Oxygen isotope ratios (δ18O values) of fish otoliths (ear bones) are valuable geochemical tracers of water conditions and thermal life history. Delta Smelt (Hypomesus transpacificus) are osmerid forage fish endemic to the San Francisco Estuary, California, USA, that are on the verge of extinction. These fish exhibit a complex life history that allows them to survive in a dynamic estuarine environment; however, a rapidly warming climate threatens this thermally sensitive species. Here we quantify the accuracy and precision of using δ18O values in otoliths to reconstruct the thermal life histories of Delta Smelt. Methods: Delta Smelt were reared for 360 days using three different water sources with different ambient δ18Owater values (−8.75‰, −5.28‰, and −4.06‰) and different water temperatures (16.4°C, 16.7°C, 18.7°C, and 20.5°C). Samples were collected after 170 days (n = 28) and 360 days (n = 14) post-hatch. In situ δ18O values were measured from the core of the otolith to the dorsal edge using secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS) to reconstruct temporally resolved thermal life histories. Results: The δ18Ootolith values for Delta Smelt varied as a linear inverse function of water temperature: 1000 ln α = 18.39 (±0.43, 1SE)(103TK−1) − 34.56 (±1.49, 1SE) and δ18Ootolith(VPDB) − δ18Owater (VPDB) = 31.34(±0.09, 1SE) − 0.19(±0.01, 1SE) × T ° C. When the ambient δ18Owater value is known, this species-specific temperature-dependent oxygen isotope fractionation model facilitated the accurate (0.25°C) and precise (±0.37°C, 2σ) reconstruction of the water temperature experienced by the fish. In contrast, the use of existing general fractionation equations resulted in inaccurate temperature reconstructions. Conclusions: The species-specific δ18Ootolith fractionation equation allowed for accurate and precise reconstructions of water temperatures experienced by Delta Smelt. Characterization of ambient δ18Owater values remains a critical next step for reconstructing thermal life histories of wild Delta Smelt. This tool will provide new insights into habitat utilization, potential thermal refugia, and resilience to future warming for this critically endangered fish.},

   abstract = {Sepioteuthis lessoniana is a widely distributed neritic squid in the Indo-Pacific Ocean. It is an important species in fisheries, but species management is difficult because of inadequate information regarding its life history. The daily growth and δ18O values from the core to the edge of statoliths of S. lessoniana collected in northern Taiwan were analyzed to predict the experienced temperature history along with ontogenetic stages. The probability of occurrence in a given area at each life stage in three seasonal groups was determined using salinity values, deduced and measured temperatures, and the known ecology of S. lessoniana. The results showed that ontogenetic variation in the statolith δ18O values in S. lessoniana reflected the seasonal temperature fluctuation observed in Taiwanese waters, which indicated the reliability of the prediction method. Complex and diverse distribution and movement patterns were observed in the three seasonal groups. The results also indicated the importance of the waters near the coast of northeastern Taiwan as a spawning ground. Based on a model prediction, the distribution of S. lessoniana is likely associated with water temperature and current. A potential migration route from the Penghu Islands to northeastern Taiwan suggests a high level of population connectivity in S. lessoniana in Taiwan. This study provides information on the spatial and vertical distribution of S. lessoniana at various ontogenetic stages, which is essential for resource management and conservation of this commercial species.},

   abstract = {Stable isotope analysis (δ18O and δ13C) of otolith aragonite was used to infer ontogenetic patterns of movement, delineate sub-population structure, and determine the mixing of Southern Garfish (Hyporhamphus melanochir) in South Australian waters. Adult garfish from the 2+ age class were collected from three sites within each of six regions along the South Australian coast: Northern Gulf St. Vincent, South West Gulf St. Vincent, Kangaroo Island, Northern Spencer Gulf, South West Spencer Gulf and the West Coast of Eyre Peninsula. Significant spatial variation was detected in mean δ18O and δ13C values among sites within regions and as a function of fish age. Salinity, rather than sea surface temperature, appeared to account for regional variation in δ18O, whereas variation in diet and metabolic processes were suggested to account for observed differences in δ13C. Otolith oxygen and carbon stable isotope values indicated that the South Australian Southern Garfish fishery is comprised of multiple, regional, population components that persist through time. Both the West Coast and Northern Spencer Gulf regions constitute distinct population components that exhibit little inter-regional mixing and therefore may be considered as discrete management units. The South West Spencer Gulf region may also be considered a separate population component, however, its level of connectivity with Gulf St. Vincent is uncertain. With the exception of juvenile garfish from Kangaroo Island, there was no clear regional separation within Gulf St. Vincent. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.},

Otolith core and edge portions were compared between and within individuals from the same cohort (n=120) to determine whether isotopically different environments were inhabited by juveniles and adults from different latitudes. A comparison between individuals revealed that δ18O and δ13C increased with latitude and were generally higher in edge than in core portions. Similarly, within most individual otoliths, δ18O and δ13C were higher in edge than in core portions. For some individuals, however, there was no difference in δ18O between core and edge portions, potentially signifying self-recruitment to the area or occupation of areas of similar chemistry. The majority of individuals from 19 to 22°S and almost half of individuals from 18°S displayed juvenile δ18O signatures characteristic of a warmer environment, suggesting movement to cooler environments or potential southerly migration of early life stages to adult habitat. In contrast, almost half of adult individuals in the most northern latitude (18°S) appeared to originate from cooler environments, suggesting movement to warmer environments or potential northward migration with ontogeny. These results infer that movement of L. miniatus individuals occurred across different isotopic environments with life stage and was related to latitude. Isotope ratios provided insight into movement patterns of L. miniatus at scales that will be important for delineating management units for this commercially important species. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

   abstract = {Analysis of stable oxygen isotopes in otoliths is a promising technique for estimating the ambient temperature experienced by fish, but consistent equations relating temperature and fractionation of stable oxygen isotopes in otoliths among different fish species are lacking. Juvenile cod were reared at constant temperatures from 6 to 20°C and the sagittal otoliths were analysed for oxygen isotope values. We determined that temperature-dependent fractionation of oxygen isotopes in the otoliths was close to that reported for inorganic aragonite at low temperatures, but there were deviations from oxygen isotope fractionation equations for otoliths of other species. The linear relationship between oxygen isotope value in the cod otoliths and temperature was determined to be: 1000 Ln α = 16.75(103TK-1) - 27.09. Temperature estimates with 1°C precision at the 95% probability level require a sample size of ≥5 otoliths. Only an insignificant amount of the variance in the data was due to variance between left and right otolith, and due to repeated measurements of otolith subsamples.

Otolith samples of pen-reared cod (Gadus morhua L.) with well-defined temperature history were obtained using this high-resolution sampling technique. Samples from different-aged cod otoliths were collected in two yearly increments corresponding to the calendar years 1994 and 1995, and the stable-oxygen (δ18O) and -carbon (δ13C) isotope compositions of the samples were measured. Otolith δ18O values had a clear seasonal pattern in response to the seasonal water temperature. Otolith material deposited in the same calendar years of different-aged fish showed similar δ18O values. High precision of the temperature estimate using otolith δ18O values was obtained when comparing results from different otoliths. The accuracy of the temperature estimates, relative to measured mean monthly water temperature, was also high, but reduced sampling resolution in the otoliths significantly reduced the accuracy due to attenuation of the δ18O signals. We found that the otolith δ13C values had a cyclic pattern, roughly in phase with the δ18O values. This was most likely caused by temperature-increased metabolism. Indications of age-specific otolith δ13C values are also presented. © Springer-Verlag 2004.},

   abstract = {Mangroves and seagrass beds have long been perceived as important nurseries for many fish species. While there is growing evidence from the Western Atlantic that mangrove habitats are intricately connected to coral reefs through ontogenetic fish migrations, there is an ongoing debate of the value of these coastal ecosystems in the Indo-Pacific. The present study used natural tags, viz. otolith stable carbon and oxygen isotopes, to investigate for the first time the degree to which multiple tropical juvenile habitats subsidize coral reef fish populations in the Indo Pacific (Tanzania). Otoliths of three reef fish species (Lethrinus harak, L. lentjan and Lutjanus fulviflamma) were collected in mangrove, seagrass and coral reef habitats and analyzed for stable isotope ratios in the juvenile and adult otolith zones. δ13C signatures were significantly depleted in the juvenile compared to the adult zones, indicative of different habitat use through ontogeny. Maximum likelihood analysis identified that 82% of adult reef L. harak had resided in either mangrove (29%) or seagrass (53%) or reef (18%) habitats as juveniles. Of adult L. fulviflamma caught from offshore reefs, 99% had passed through mangroves habitats as juveniles. In contrast, L. lentjan adults originated predominantly from coral reefs (65-72%) as opposed to inshore vegetated habitats (28-35%). This study presents conclusive evidence for a nursery role of Indo-Pacific mangrove habitats for reef fish populations. It shows that intertidal habitats that are only temporarily available can form an important juvenile habitat for some species, and that reef fish populations are often replenished by multiple coastal habitats. Maintaining connectivity between inshore vegetated habitats and coral reefs, and conserving habitat mosaics rather than single nursery habitats, is a major priority for the sustainability of various Indo Pacific fish populations. © 2013 Kimirei et al.},

Fishery independent data collected with bag seines throughout the GBC from 1999 to 2009 were used to predict the probability of southern flounder occurrence. Binomial GAMs were used to assess presence/absence of southern flounder and models included temporal variables, benthic variables such as distance to habitats generated within a geographic information system, and physicochemical conditions of the water column. Separate models were generated for newly settled southern flounder, young-of-the-year (YOY) southern flounder observed in the summer, and YOY southern flounder observed in fall based on size and collection month. Factors affecting southern flounder occurrence changed seasonally, as did the corresponding shifts in the spatial distribution of suitable habitat. Temporal effects (year and month) were retained in all models. Physicochemical conditions (temperature, turbidity, and measures of environmental variability), and the presence of seagrass beds were influential for newly settled southern flounder. Distance to marine and/or freshwater sources were found to be important for YOY southern flounder in the summer and fall seasons. The abundance of brown shrimp was found to only influence the distribution of YOY southern flounder in the fall, when intermediate abundances of the potential prey item increased the occurrence of southern flounder. After model completion, the availability and spatial distribution of suitable habitat within the GBC was predicted using available environmental and spatial data for 2005. Spatial distributions of predicted suitable habitat stress the relative importance of West Bay during the newly settled stage and in the fall season, and Upper Bay during the summer and fall of the first year of life. These models demonstrate the potential dynamics of suitable habitats for juvenile southern flounder and provide insight into ontogenetic shifts in habitat preference during the first year of life. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

Based upon the weighted-mean stable isotope values, the sites were classified as coastal Atlantic, inland, and lower Florida Keys. The coastal Atlantic sites had weighted-mean values of δ18O and δD of -2.86‰ and -12.8‰, respectively, and exhibited a seasonal variation with lower δ18O and δD values in the summer wet-season precipitation (δ18O = -3.38‰, δD = -16.5‰) as compared to the winter-time precipitation (δ18O = -1.66‰, δD = -3.2‰). The inland site was characterized as having the highest d-excess value (+13.3‰), signifying a contribution of evaporated Everglades surface water to the local atmospheric moisture. In spite of its lower latitude, the lower Keys site located at Long Key had the lowest weighted-mean stable isotope values (δ18O = -3.64‰, δD = -20.2‰) as well as the lowest d-excess value of (+8.8‰). The lower δD and δ18O values observed at the Long Key site reflect the combined effects of oceanic vapor source, fractionation due to local precipitation, and slower equilibration of the larger raindrops nucleated by a maritime aerosol. Very low δ18O and δD values (δ18O < -6‰, δD < -40‰) were observed just prior to the passage of hurricanes from the Gulf of Mexico as well as during cold fronts from the north-west. These results suggest that an oceanic vapor source region to the west, may be responsible for the extremely low δD and δ18O values observed during some tropical storms and cold fronts. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

However, the interplay between isotopic fractionation associated with the internal nitrogen cycling and variations in the absolute values supplied by external source signatures is poorly understood. Here we report the δ 15N and δ 13C of algae, sponges, and fishes, the δ 15N and δ 18O of dissolved NO 3-, and the δ 15N of dissolved organic nitrogen in samples collected from the Florida reef tract over a 2.5-yr period (2003-2005). Our data are synthesized with results from previous studies of the δ 15N of particulate organic material and coral tissue and zooxanthellae from the same area to provide a more detailed understanding of factors controlling coral reef δ 15N and variation among biogenic components. These data show that during the study period there were (1) no clear spatial patterns in the δ 15N of biogenic components related to proximity to the Florida Reef tract, and (2) no temporal patterns related to the wet or dry seasons. The range of δ 15N and δ 13C in the particulate organic material could be best explained as a mixture of material derived from seagrass, algae, mangroves, and fishes. The δ 15N and δ 18O of NO 3- support a model in which variations in nitrogen isotopic composition are derived mainly from the isotopic effects associated with the nitrification of NH 4+ to NO 3- and subsequent assimilation by primary producers rather than through the input of isotopically distinct NO 3- from external sources. © 2012 Rosenstiel School of Marine and Atmospheric Science.},

Widely applied paleotemperature equations may mix non-equilibrium foraminifera with equilibrium synthetic calcite, resulting in temperature sensitivities that are too large. Warm-water foraminiferal calibrations may give temperature sensitivities that are too small for very cold waters. Here we combine new core top measurements from the Florida Straits and the Arctic Ocean with published data to derive new δ18O:temperature relationships for three groups of benthic foraminifera. We derive a quadratic equation for Cibicidoides and Planulina that agrees well with equilibrium synthetic calcite, and that should be applicable over all oceanographic temperatures. We find that Uvigerina is not at equilibrium and is isotopically heavier than Cibicidoides and Planulina by 0.47‰, in contrast to the historically used 0.64‰. Hoeglundina elegans is further enriched and appears to be slightly heavier than equilibrium aragonite. Finally we discuss the implications of the Florida Straits observations for the hypothesis that benthic foraminifera precipitate their shells from a pH-dependent mixture of bicarbonate and carbonate ions. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

   abstract = {Donax variabilis, the variable coquina clam, has been a common inhabitant of exposed sandy beach intertidal and shallow subtidal zones in the southeastern United States throughout the Pleistocene and Holocene. It is ideally suited for paleotemperature studies because it is restricted to environments of well-mixed, normal-marine seawater with a fairly uniform isotopic composition. As a result, oxygen isotopic variability in D. variabilis shells is largely explained by temperature variation. Although D. variabilis is small and short-lived, its shell represents an important paleoclimate archive because of its unique habitat preference. High-resolution sampling of individual D. variabilis shells and comparison of oxygen isotopic temperature profiles with historical seawater temperatures from the northeastern Florida coast indicate rapid shell growth over a brief life span of three to five or six months. Analysis of two modern shells reveals a close correspondence between isotopically determined water temperatures and historical water temperatures during the spring-summer growing season. Paleotemperature profiles from four archaeological shells, however, suggest a longer growth interval spanning summer-autumn. Two Preceramic Archaic Period shells (ca. 4240 and 5570 14C yr BP) and two Orange Period Archaic shells (ca. 3600 and 3760 14C yr BP), from four different archaeological sites, yield paleotemperatures that average 3.5°C higher than present summer-autumn water temperatures. These warm paleotemperatures highlight seasonality differences associated with the mid-Holocene Hypsithermal climatic interval in this region. © 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

   abstract = {Fish otoliths are aragonitic accretions located within the inner ear of teleost fish. The acellular nature of otoliths, along with taxon-specific shapes, chronological growth increments, and abundance in the fossil record suggest that the stable isotope chemistry of these structures may be unique recorders of environmental conditions experienced by fish in both modern and ancient water masses. To assess the factors determining δ 13C and δ 18O fractionation in fish otoliths, we reared Atlantic croaker (Micropogonias undulatus) larvae under controlled environmental conditions. Metabolic effects apparently generated large isotopic disequilibria in the δ 13C values of M. undulatus otoliths. We found evidence of a negative regression between δ 13Ccarbonate-δ 13Cwater (Δ 13C) and temperature: Δ 13C = -1.78 - 0.18 T°C However, this relationship was aliased to a degree by a positive correlation between Δ 13C and somatic growth and otolith precipitation rates. Oxygen isotopes were deposited close to equilibrium with the ambient water. The relationship between temperature and the 18O/16O fractionation factor (α) was determined empirically to be: 1000 In α = 18.56(103 T K-1) - 32.54 The fractionation factor was not affected by either otolith precipitation or fish growth rates. Reconstruction of water temperature histories should, therefore, be possible from the δ 18O values of M. undulatus otoliths with a precision of 1°C, providing the δ 18O of the ambient water can be estimated.

Here, we propose a refinement to tree-cellulose paleoclimatology modeling, using the cellulose-derived compound phenylglucosazone as the isotopic substrate. Stem samples from trees were collected at northern latitudes as low as 24°37′N and as high as 69°00′N. We extracted stem water and cellulose from each stem sample and analyzed them for their 18O content. In addition, we derived the cellulose to phenylglucosazone, a compound which lacks the oxygen attached to the second carbon of the cellulose-glucose moieties. Oxygen isotope analysis of phenylglucosazone allowed us to calculate the 18O content of the oxygen attached to the second carbon of the cellulose-glucose moieties. By way of these analyses, we tested two hypotheses: first, that the 18O content of the oxygen attached to second carbon will more closely reflect the 18O content of the stem water, and will not resemble the 18O content of either cellulose or its derivative phenylglucosazone. Second, tree-ring models that incorporate the variable oxygen isotope fractionation shown here and elsewhere are more accurate than those that do not. Our first hypothesis was rejected on the basis that the oxygen isotope ratios of the oxygen attached to the second carbon of the glucose moieties had a noisy isotopic signal with a large standard deviation and gave the poorest correlation with the oxygen isotope ratios of stem water. Related to this isotopic noise, we observed that the correlation between oxygen isotope ratios of phenylglucosazone with both stem water and relative humidity were higher than those observed for cellulose. Our hypothesis about tree-ring models which account for changes in the oxygen isotopic fractionation during cellulose synthesis was consistent only for the 18O content of phenylglucosazone. We showed that the tree-ring model based on the 18O content of phenylglucosazone was an improvement over existing models that are based on whole cellulose. Additionally, this approach may be used in other cellulose based archives such as peat deposits and lacustrine sediments. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

   abstract = {Conventional tags applied to individuals have been used to investigate animal movement, but these methods require tagged individuals be recaptured. Maps of regional isotopic variability known as “isoscapes” offer potential for various applications in migration research without tagging wherein isotope values of tissues are compared to environmental isotope values. In this study, we present the spatial variability in oxygen (δ18OH2O) and dissolved inorganic carbon (δ13CDIC) isotope values of Baltic Sea water. We also provide an example of how these isoscapes can reveal locations of individual animal via spatial probability surface maps, using the high-resolution salmon otolith isotope data from salmon during their sea-feeding phase in the Baltic Sea. A clear latitudinal and vertical gradient was found for both (δ18OH2O) and δ13CDIC values. The difference between summer and winter in the Baltic Sea (δ18OH2O) values was only slight, whereas δ13CDIC values exhibited substantial seasonal variability related to algal productivity. Salmon otolith δ18Ooto and δ13Coto values showed clear differences between feeding areas and seasons. Our example demonstrates that dual isotope approach offers great potential for estimating probable fish habitats once issues in model parameterization have been resolved.},

The common isotopic systems of carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, strontium, and lead are described in terms of basic principles, specifically with references of human bone and tooth enamel. Isotopic analyses of carbon and nitrogen in collagen for past diet provides information on certain food types (e.g., C4 plants, marine resources, freshwater fish) and trophic level, while the analysis of oxygen, strontium, and lead can provide information on local vs. non-local origins, mobility, and place of origin. Analysis of tooth enamel provides information on childhood contexts, and the analysis of adult bone provides information on the later years of life. This paper is intended to provide the methodological background for the isotopic analysis of human and faunal materials from the Viking colonization of the North Atlantic.},

   abstract = {The factors of climate and geography which produce salinity gradients and affect the molluscan fauna distribution in Florida Bay also cause variations in the $\delta O^\{18\}$ composition of Florida Bay water. The isotopic composition of bay water varies in response to (1) mixing of Atlantic and Gulf of Mexico waters having a relatively constant isotopic composition with bay water along the western and southeastern margins; (2) evaporation of Florida Bay water which causes isotopie enrichment over the entire bay; (3) the introduction of isotopically enriched fresh water along the northern margin of the bay. The net effect of these processes is to produce a persistent gradient of increasing $\delta O^\{18\}$ from south to north in the bay water while water outside the bay is maintained at a lower and more constant isotopic composition. Isotopie ratios from eight species of Florida Bay mollusk shells reflect clearly the sharp contrast between bay and open water $\delta O^\{18\}$ compositions and, to varying degrees, the gradient of increasing $\delta O^\{18\}$ in the bay itself. Temperature along could not cause the variations found. Measurement of $\delta C^\{13\}$ in Florida Bay mollusk shells reveals a gradient of decreasing $\delta C^\{13\}$ going from open-shelf water into the bay. The gradient is attributed to the equilibration of $CO_\{2\}$ derived locally from the oxidation of organic debris in the sediment with carbonate ions in the water.},

   abstract = {Sulfur cycling in Fe-poor, organic-rich shelf carbonates, known to have rapid rates of SO4-2 reduction, remains poorly studied despite the volumetric significance of shelf deposits in modern and ancient carbon budgets. We investigated sulfur cycling in modern carbonates of the Florida Platform from end-member depositional environments (muddy sands from the Atlantic reef tract and finer-grained mudbank and island flank deposits from Florida Bay). Relations between pore water chemistry (SO4-2, ΣCO2, Ca-2/Cl-) and oxygen and sulfur stable isotope compositions of SO4-2 require direct coupling between sulfur redox cycling and syndepositional carbonate dissolution. Oxygen isotope compositions of pore water sulfate were remarkably shifted away from the established value for marine SO4-2 (+9.5‰), despite near normal SO4-2/Cl- ratios. Chemical evolution was least in reef tract pore waters and greatest in Florida Bay. Relative to overlying seawater, mudbank sediments exhibited sulfate depletion, with δ18O(SO4) and δ34S(SO4) values both increasing by about 7‰. More bioturbated island flank sediments, colonized by Thalassia grass, had a 5‰ increase in δ18O(SO4), variable δ34S(SO4) values (+17.7 to +23.3‰) and exceptionally high Ca+2/CL- ratios. The large excess of Ca+2 (up to 1.7 mM) requires a much larger acid source than the amounts derived from utilization of dissolved O2 (~0.3 mM) and small degrees of net SO4-2 reduction (<0.5 mM reduced). A conceptual model was constructed using chemical and isotopic data on natural pore waters and on sulfate isotope fractionation factors obtained from sediment incubation experiments. The model outputs show that pore water compositions can be explained by a redox cycle where microbial SO4-2 reduction is followed by very efficient H2S oxidation, thus maintaining virtually invariant SO4-2/Cl- ratios. The enhanced O2 transport may be driven by associated marine grass rhizome systems and microbial communities established in bioturbated sediments. The net result of the cycle is that the rate of sulfide oxidation, which is largely balanced by the rate of microbial sulfate reduction, is stoichiometrically related to the rate of carbonate dissolution. This is consistent with previously reported rates of carbonate dissolution (~400 μmol/cm2-yr) and average rates of sulfate reduction (~200 μmol/cm2-yr) from the Florida Platform and a 2:1 stoichiometry.},

This analytical approach of the ion probe was applied to deep-sea fishes to reconstruct the likely depths inhabited by the fishes at different life history stages based on the measured δ18Ootolith values as a proxy of water temperature. Dramatic increases up to 5-6‰ in δ18Ootolith, representing a temperature decrease of approximately 20°C, were detected in a blind cusk eel (Barathronus maculatus) otolith and in the otoliths of Synaphobranchus kaupii during leptocephalus metamorphosis to glass eel, inferred from the drop of otolith Sr/Ca ratios and increase of otolith growth increment width. δ18Ootolith profiles clearly divided the fish's life history into a planktonic stage in the mixed layer of the ocean and a benthic stage on the deep-sea ocean bottom. The habitat shift signal was recorded within a 150μm width of otolith growth zone, which was too narrow to be clearly detected by mechanical drilling and conventional isotopic ratio mass spectrometry. However, variations down to -7‰ were found in δ18Ootolith profiles as the result of Cs2+ beam sputter in the core and larval portions of the otoliths. Carbon mapping by electron probe microanalyzer and staining by toluidine blue suggested abundant proteins existed in the areas with anomaly negative δ18Ootolith values, which cannot be interpreted as a habitat change but due to the isotopic fractionation by O emission from the proteins. These results implied that careful design and understanding of the chemical composition of the analytical areas or tracks on the heterogeneous otolith was essential for highly accurate and precise analysis. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

Although, these waters ranged in salinity from 27 to 120 g kg-1, most were found to have very similar hydrogen and oxygen isotopic compositions (δ18O = + 2 to + 4‰, δD= + 5 to + 25‰). In order to explain these observations we have applied the Craig-Gordon and Gonflantini evaporation models which account for oxygen and hydrogen isotopic fractionation during the desiccation of saline water bodies. These models provide excellent agreement for the evaporation of water into an environment with a relative humidity of 77%, a temperature of 25°C and atmospheric water vapor possessing δ18O- and δD-values of -11 and -75‰, respectively. The salinity of fluids from one core on Cluett Key (26.9 g kg-1) was well below that of the surrounding bay (> 40 g kg-1 and the water from this locality was depleted in both D and 18O. These δ18O- and δD-values, plotted together with other data from this study, fall on a line possessing a slope of 4.90 ( ± 0.41), similar to what would be expected from the evaporation models. This line intersects the meteoric water line at δ18O and δD-values which are within error, similar to average δ18O- and δD-values measured for rainfall in the Miami area. © 1989.},

Carbon dioxide and methane are important greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, dissolved inorganic (DIC) and organic carbon (DOC) determine water biogeochemistry, and carbonates are major constituents of marine sediments. Stable carbon isotope ratios (13C/12C), expressed as δ13C values, are widely used in modern Earth sciences. δ13CCO2 values of atmospheric carbon dioxide reflect global climate evolution and change. Marine δ13CDIC is used as water-mass tracer and helps quantifying the anthropogenic CO2 uptake of the ocean. The δ13C values of fossil planktic and benthic carbonates indicate changes in circulation pattern and deep-water ventilation of ancient oceans, as well as paleoproductivity at the sea surface and methane release at the sea floor. The δ13COM values of sedimentary organic matter (OM) and compound-specific δ13C values of molecular organic biomarkers indicate whether the organic carbon is of marine or terrestrial provenience. Secular δ13C variations and excursions in carbonates are important stratigraphic marker and tie points. Here we review the application of stable carbon isotope ratios in ocean water and biogenic carbonates as proxies in paleoceanography, including the atmospheric and sedimentary reservoirs oceanic carbon is in exchange with. Due to the wide use of δ13C values in Earth sciences, this overview necessarily does not claim to be complete; rather we focus on field-based stable carbon isotope research and its significance in paleoceanography. This may assist in evaluating general circulation model results and foster development of new innovative proxies.},

   abstract = {Analysis of naturally occurring variation in otolith elemental composition has become a common approach for retrospectively determining migratory history in diadromous fishes. Environmental factors, such as temperature, salinity, and ambient water concentration, can independently, or in an interactive manner, affect elemental incorporation rates. Furthermore, the relative importance of kinetic and metabolic (or "vital") effects on elemental incorporation remains unclear. In this study, a repeated measures design was used to: (1) quantify the effects of water temperature (9°C, 12°C, 15°C) and freshwater Ba:Ca levels (low, intermediate, and high) on elemental partitioning and otolith composition (Mg:Ca, Sr:Ca, Ba:Ca) in juvenile Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) along a salinity gradient (0, 5, 10, 14); and (2) estimate the lag time between physical exposure to chemically distinct water masses and changes in otolith composition. Additionally, relationships between elemental incorporation and somatic and otolith growth rates were evaluated across and within temperature treatments to identify potential rate effects. Otolith incorporation of Sr and Ba was positively related to water concentration whereas Mg incorporation was not. For Sr and Mg, there were significant interactions between temperature and salinity (p⇐0.01). For Ba, there were complex interactions among temperature, water Ba:Ca values, and salinity (p⇐0.01). In certain instances, interactive effects of temperature and salinity were large enough to confound interpretation of field data. Furthermore, there was evidence for negative effects of somatic growth rate on the incorporation of Ba that were consistent across temperatures (r=⇐0.32 to ⇐0.72). Observations were consistently contrary to expectations based on models of elemental incorporation for abiotic aragonite, highlighting the importance of vital effects and indicating that species-specific models of incorporation may be necessary. Changes in otolith composition were detected within 2-3. d of a change in water composition but otolith composition did not stabilize for 12-14. d, indicating that habitat transitions should be discernable in a short period of time but the otolith may not reflect ambient water levels for up to 2. weeks. These observations underscore the need to evaluate the effects of abiotic and biotic factors on otolith elemental incorporation in settings that mimic natural conditions to accurately interpret field data. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

In November 2010 and 2011, dissolved carbon source-sink dynamics was examined in these rivers during SF6 tracer release experiments. Approximately 80 % of the total dissolved carbon flux out of the Shark and Harney rivers during these experiments was in the form of inorganic carbon, either via air-water CO2 exchange or longitudinal flux of dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) to the coastal ocean. Between 42 and 48 % of the total mangrove-derived DIC flux into the rivers was emitted to the atmosphere, with the remaining being discharged to the coastal ocean. Dissolved organic carbon (DOC) represented ca. 10 % of the total mangrove-derived dissolved carbon flux from the forests to the rivers. The sum of mangrove-derived DIC and DOC export from the forest to these rivers was estimated to be at least 18.9 to 24.5 mmol m-2 d-1, a rate lower than other independent estimates from Shark River and from other mangrove forests. Results from these experiments also suggest that in Shark and Harney rivers, mangrove contribution to the estuarine flux of dissolved carbon to the ocean is less than 10 %.},

   abstract = {Five regression models (Poisson, negative binomial, quasi-Poisson, the hurdle model and the zero-inflated Poisson) were used to assess the relationship between the abundance of a vulnerable plant species, Leionema ralstonii, and the environment. The methods differed in their capacity to deal with common properties of ecological data. They were assessed theoretically, and their predictive performance was evaluated with correlation, calibration and error statistics calculated within a bootstrap evaluation procedure that simulated performance for independent data. The hurdle model performed best, with the highest correlations between the observed and predicted abundances. This model was also well calibrated, giving the closest agreement between observed and predicted abundances. The negative binomial was the worst performing model. It had weaker correlations than the other models and resulted in a strong, inconsistent bias in predictions. The standard Poisson model which accommodates neither zero-inflation nor over-dispersion gave accurate estimates of regional population abundance, but at the individual population level they were inconsistent and biased. The strong performance of the hurdle model, coupled with theoretical properties that suit it for these data and for the ecology of this species, suggest that it is a useful alternative to other modelling methods. The gains in performance have practical advantages where predictions are used by conservation planners to understand population dynamics or to assess the relative risks of alternative management scenarios. © 2006 Elsevier B.V.

Here, we used a horizon scanning exercise to yield 100 research questions related to recreational fisheries science and management in the Anthropocene. Initial research questions (n = 205) were collected from recreational fisheries experts (i.e., stakeholders, managers, researchers) from various sectors (i.e., industry, government, NGOs) and geographic locations (14 countries: Australia, Brazil, Canada, Czech Republic, Germany, Italy, New Zealand, Norway, South Africa, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, United Kingdom, USA). These questions were subsequently categorized, thematized, and refined by our authorship team, eventually yielding what we considered to be the top 100 research questions of relevance to management of recreational fisheries. The key themes include: human dimensions; bioeconomics; resource monitoring and data acquisition; governance; management—regulatory actions; management—stock and habitat enhancement; catch-and-release; impacts of recreational fisheries on populations, communities and ecosystems; threats and sustainability; and angler outreach, education and engagement. It is our intention that this comprehensive and forward-looking list will create a framework to guide future research within this field, and contribute to evidence-based recreational fisheries management and policy.},

   abstract = {The marine environment of the Gulf of Mexico is sensitive to both oceanographic and climatic processes, and a better understanding of how seawater properties in the gulf vary can provide valuable insight into the nature of these processes. During the period of 2004 through 2006, seawater samples were collected along the Texas- Louisiana continental shelf near the Mississippi and Atchafalaya River deltas and at the Flower Garden Banks near the continental shelf/slope boundary. The salinity and oxygen isotope values of these waters samples were measured. Samples from the Flower Garden Banks established that the typical salinity and d18O values of openocean waters in the Gulf of Mexico are 36.1 and 1.1%, respectively. The salinity-d18O relationships of waters on the shelf varied temporally and spatially due to changes in the relative contributions of fresh waters entering the gulf from riverine sources. This improved understanding of the composition and relative contributions of the shelf-water end members in the northern Gulf of Mexico will contribute to our ability to quantify shelf circulation, biogeochemical processes such as hypoxia, and the history of climate in this important region. © 2011 Rosenstiel School of Marine and Atmospheric Science of the University of Miami.},

   abstract = {To assess spatial, seasonal, and source variability in stable isotopic composition of human drinking waters throughout the entire USA, we have constructed a database of δ18O and δ2H of US tap waters. An additional purpose was to create a publicly available dataset useful for evaluating the forensic applicability of these isotopes for human tissue source geolocation. Samples were obtained at 349 sites, from diverse population centres, grouped by surface hydrologic units for regional comparisons. Samples were taken concurrently during two contrasting seasons, summer and winter. Source supply (surface, groundwater, mixed, and cistern) and system (public and private) types were noted. The isotopic composition of tap waters exhibits large spatial and regional variation within each season as well as significant at-site differences between seasons at many locations, consistent with patterns found in environmental (river and precipitation) waters deriving from hydrologic processes influenced by geographic factors. However, anthropogenic factors, such as the population of a tap's surrounding community and local availability from diverse sources, also influence the isotopic composition of tap waters. Even within a locale as small as a single metropolitan area, tap waters with greatly differing isotopic compositions can be found, so that tap water within a region may not exhibit the spatial or temporal coherence predicted for environmental water. Such heterogeneities can be confounding factors when attempting forensic inference of source water location, and they underscore the necessity of measurements, not just predictions, with which to characterize the isotopic composition of regional tap waters.},

Depth, salinity, temperature, and distance from the Bay mouth were found to be the most important environmental determinants of mature female blue crab distributions. The response curves for these variables displayed patterns that are consistent with laboratory and field studies of blue crab/habitat relationships. The generality of the habitat models was assessed using intra- and inter-annual cross-validation. Although the models generally performed well in cross-validation, some years showed unique habitat relationships that were not well predicted by models from other years.

Zero inflated data are defined as data that has a larger proportion of zeros than expected from pure count (Poisson) data. The standard methodology is to model the data in two steps, first modelling the association between the presence and absence of a species and the available covariates and second, modelling the relationship between abundance and the covariates, conditional on the organism being present. The approach in this paper extends previous work to incorporate the use of Generalized Additive Models (GAM) in the modelling steps. The paper develops the link and variance functions needed for the use of GAM with zero inflated data.

AdaBoost algorithm was applied to the model analyses with such fishery data for each species. The 3- and 5-fold cross-validations were conducted to evaluate the performance of each candidate model. The performance of the delta model consisting of one generalized additive model and one AdaBoost model (Delta-AdaBoost) was compared with five candidate models. The five candidate models included: the delta model comprising two generalized linear models (Delta-GLM), the delta model comprising two generalized linear models with polynomial terms up to degree 3 (Delta-GLM-Poly), the delta model comprising two generalized additive models (Delta-GAM), the generalized linear model with Tweedie distribution (GLM-Tweedie), and the generalized additive model with Tweedie distribution (GAM-Tweedie). To predict the presence/absence of fish species, the performance of AdaBoost model was compared in terms of error rate with conventional generalized linear and additive models assuming a binomial distribution. Results from 3- and 5-fold cross-validation indicated that Delta-AdaBoost model yielded the smallest training error (0.431-0.433 for walleye, 0.528-0.519 for yellow perch and 0.251 for white perch) and test error (0.435-0.436 for walleye, 0.524 for yellow perch and 0.254-0.255 for white perch) on average, followed by Delta-GLM-Poly model for yellow perch and white perch, and Delta-GAM model for walleye. In the prediction of the presence/absence of fish species, AdaBoost model had the lowest error rate, compared with generalized linear and additive models.

   abstract = {We evaluate the performance of generalized linear (GLM) and generalized additive (GAM) models for deriving population indices from fishery independent survey data. Six model types (3 GLMs and 3 GAMs) were formulated that differed in how spatial covariates were represented, with each using one of three alternative ways to include temporal covariates. The models were applied to summer and fall survey data on 127 species from fisheries-independent bottom-trawl surveys conducted by the Southeast Monitoring and Assessment Program (SEAMAP) in the northwest Gulf of Mexico. Three response variables were analyzed: occurrence, density, and abundance. The best model (from the alternative temporal representations) were identified for each response variable for each of the six model types and their performance analyzed in more detail. Model performance was based on residual autocorrelation (Moran's I), prediction error (AIC weights), and predication variance (based on simulated sampling). We examined for patterns in these metrics based on the magnitude of the response variables (i.e., by quartiles). Results suggest that sample size (indexed here by response value quartiles) could be useful for a priori consideration when choosing among GLM and GAM models. GAM models that use geoposition with smoothing as the spatial covariate performed comparable to some of the other models at low abundances and densities (lower quartiles), and significantly outperformed all of the other models at higher densities and abundances (quartiles 3 and 4). We discuss how our results provide guidance on selecting GLM and GAM models for deriving population indices from survey data.},

   abstract = {Recent work by Reiss and Ogden provides a theoretical basis for sometimes preferring restricted maximum likelihood (REML) to generalized cross-validation (GCV) for smoothing parameter selection in semiparametric regression. However, existing REML or marginal likelihood (ML) based methods for semiparametric generalized linear models (GLMs) use iterative REML or ML estimation of the smoothing parameters of working linear approximations to the GLM. Such indirect schemes need not converge and fail to do so in a non-negligible proportion of practical analyses. By contrast, very reliable prediction error criteria smoothing parameter selection methods are available, based on direct optimization of GCV, or related criteria, for the GLM itself. Since such methods directly optimize properly defined functions of the smoothing parameters, they have much more reliable convergence properties. The paper develops the first such method for REML or ML estimation of smoothing parameters. A Laplace approximation is used to obtain an approximate REML or ML for any GLM, which is suitable for efficient direct optimization. This REML or ML criterion requires that Newton-Raphson iteration, rather than Fisher scoring, be used for GLM fitting, and a computationally stable approach to this is proposed. The REML or ML criterion itself is optimized by a Newton method, with the derivatives required obtained by a mixture of implicit differentiation and direct methods. The method will cope with numerical rank deficiency in the fitted model and in fact provides a slight improvement in numerical robustness on the earlier method of Wood for prediction error criteria based smoothness selection. Simulation results suggest that the new REML and ML methods offer some improvement in mean-square error performance relative to GCV or Akaike's information criterion in most cases, without the small number of severe undersmoothing failures to which Akaike's information criterion and GCV are prone. This is achieved at the same computational cost as GCV or Akaike's information criterion. The new approach also eliminates the convergence failures of previous REML- or ML-based approaches for penalized GLMs and usually has lower computational cost than these alternatives. Example applications are presented in adaptive smoothing, scalar on function regression and generalized additive model selection. © 2010 Royal Statistical Society.},

Brown trout showed greater variation in time spent in natal tributaries, suggesting that individuals are temporally distributing risk among offspring. By contrast, rainbow trout showed greater variation in natal origin, suggesting that individuals are spatially distributing risk among offspring.

   abstract = {The selection of thermal habitat by fish is strongly regulated by physiology and behaviour. However, delineation of a species lifelong thermal niche remains technically challenging. Lake trout (Salvelinus namaycush) survival and productivity are recognised as being tightly linked to a somewhat restricted thermal habitat. The factors guiding temperature selection during each life stage remain poorly understood. In this study, we tested the significant factors controlling the realised thermal niche of lake trout from two southern Quebec small boreal lakes that experienced supplementation stocking during the last 20 years. We used oxygen stable isotope (δ18O) thermometry of otolith calcium carbonates (aragonite) using secondary-ion mass spectrometry to estimate experienced lifelong temperatures. We investigated the thermal habitat of lake trout with known genotypes (local, hybrid, and stocked). Ontogeny and genetic origin influenced temperature selection in both studied lake trout populations. Young-of-the-year consistently used warmer, shallower habitats (10.7 ± 2.6°C, 7.5 m depth) prior to a juvenile transition to colder and deeper waters (8.5 ± 3.3°C, 10 m depth). Stocked lake trout, originating from a genetically distinct ecotype, exhibited a more variable thermal niche, with some individuals consistently using warmer habitat (10.4 ± 1°C) than local fish. Their hybrid progeny also occupied a warmer thermal niche, intermediate to the parental strains. We propose that increased fat content and genetic origin are potential explanatory factors for warmer temperature use. This study reiterates that high-resolution otolith δ18O thermometry is a uniquely well-suited approach for unravelling the multiple factors that influence lifelong temperature selection in fish. Our results illustrate that the realised thermal niche is influenced by a genetic–environment interaction.},

The δ18Ooto values for migrants recorded during the eastward trans-Pacific migration were higher than those for residents during the same period. The higher δ18Ooto values for migrants reflect the low water temperatures encountered during their migration.

   abstract = {Metabolic rate underpins our understanding of how species survive, reproduce and interact with their environment, but can be difficult to measure in wild fish. Stable carbon isotopes (δ13C) in ear stones (otoliths) of fish may reflect lifetime metabolic signatures but experimental validation is required to advance our understanding of the relationship. To this end, we reared juvenile Australasian snapper (Chrysophrys auratus), an iconic fishery species, at different temperatures and used intermittent-flow respirometry to calculate standard metabolic rate (SMR), maximum metabolic rate (MMR) and absolute aerobic scope (AAS). Subsequently, we analysed δ13C and oxygen isotopes (δ18O) in otoliths using isotope-ratio mass spectrometry. We found that under increasing temperatures, δ13C and δ18O significantly decreased, while SMR and MMR significantly increased. Negative logarithmic relationships were found between δ13C in otoliths and both SMR and MMR, while exponential decay curves were observed between proportions of metabolically sourced carbon in otoliths (Moto) and both measured and theoretical SMR.We show that basal energy for subsistence living and activity metabolism, both core components of field metabolic rates, contribute towards incorporation of δ13C into otoliths and support the use of δ13C as a metabolic proxy in field settings. The functional shapes of the logarithmic and exponential decay curves indicated that physiological thresholds regulate relationships between δ13C and metabolic rates due to upper thresholds of Moto. Here, we present quantitative experimental evidence to support the development of an otolithbased metabolic proxy, which could be a powerful tool in reconstructing lifetime biological trends in wild fish.},

Aquatic protected areas (APAs) are used to help maintain and even restore aquatic systems and their associated biota, including fish species that are popular with recreational anglers. Paradoxically, the use of APAs has been a source of much contention and conflict between members of the recreational angling community and those interested in or mandated to protect aquatic resources on the basis of the interests of multiple stakeholder groups. The angling community is concerned about the loss of fishing opportunities and effectiveness of APAs. Although it is still unclear whether establishment of APAs alone can effectively protect aquatic resources, actively including the recreational angling community in the design, implementation, and management of APAs will help ensure the values of this rather substantial user group are incorporated into aquatic conservation strategies. Conversely, the probability of increasing the sustainability of recreational angling and related economies will be greatest if recreational angler groups remain open minded to both short-term and long-term goals of fisheries conservation strategies, including the use of APAs. ©2010 Society for Conservation Biology.},

We sampled a suite of aquatic and terrestrial variables (i.e., water quality, aquatic and terrestrial macrophytes, soil compaction, anthropogenic refuse) at 14 high shoreline angling-activity sites (identified by way of interviews with conservation officers and angling clubs) within an urban area (Ottawa, Canada). For each high angling-activity site, a nearby corresponding low angling-activity site was sampled for comparison. We found that the percentage of barren area and soil compaction were greater in areas of high angling activity compared with areas that experienced relatively low angling activity. In addition, terrestrial and aquatic macrophyte density, height, and diversity were lower at high angling-activity sites. Angling- and non-angling-related litter was present in large quantities at each of the high angling-activity sites, and comparatively little litter was found at low angling-activity sites. Collectively, these findings indicate that shoreline angling does alter the riparian environment, contributing to pollution and environmental degradation in areas of high angling intensity. With growing interest in providing urban angling opportunities and in response to increasing interest in developing protected areas and parks, a better understanding of the ecologic impacts of shoreline angling is necessary to address multiuser conflicts, to develop angler outreach and educational materials, and to optimize management of angling effort to maintain ecologic integrity of riparian and aquatic ecosystems. © 2009 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.},

Factor analysis identified four multiattribute factors as important in the selection of fishing location: CLEAN ENVIRONMENT CATCH, COST AND HARVEST and AMENITIES AND SAFETY. In general, the importance of site selection factors differed little among anglers grouped by preferred type of fish, preferred fishing location (lakes and reservoirs, rivers and streams, ponds, or reservoir tailwaters), usual manner of fishing (engine-powered boat, nonpowered boat, or shore), or change in fishing frequency. COST AND HARVEST was more important to anglers with high harvest orientations. We found low correlations between site selection factor importance scores and angler age, fishing frequency, fishing expenditures, or fishing motivation factors. We suggest that the general lack of differences in site selection factors among angler groups indicates that management strategies to improve fishing site attributes should benefit all angler groups. Clean fishing environments and awareness of the availability of desired sport fishes were "very" or "extremely" important to fishing site selection by more than 70% of Mississippi freshwater anglers and should be priority management objectives.},

These objects were the first to produce ultraviolet ionizing photons in a period when the cosmic gas changed from a neutral state to an ionized one, known as Epoch of Reionization (EoR). A pivotal aspect to comprehend the EoR is to probe the intertwined relationship between the fraction of ionizing photons capable to escape dark haloes, also known as the escape fraction ($f_\{esc\}$), and the physical properties of the galaxy. This work develops a sound statistical model suitable to account for such non-linear relationships and the non-Gaussian nature of $f_\{esc\}$. This model simultaneously estimates the probability that a given primordial galaxy starts the ionizing photon production and estimates the mean level of the $f_\{esc\}$ once it is triggered. The model was employed in the First Billion Years simulation suite, from which we show that the baryonic fraction and the rate of ionizing photons appear to have a larger impact on $f_\{esc\}$ than previously thought. A naive univariate analysis of the same problem would suggest smaller effects for these properties and a much larger impact for the specific star formation rate, which is lessened after accounting for other galaxy properties and non-linearities in the statistical model.},

We assessed the nursery role of northern Gulf of Mexico seagrass meadows for gray snapper, lane snapper, and gag recruiting to Alabama’s extensive offshore reef complex. We accomplished this using broadscale juvenile trawl surveys and geochemical tags—indicative of past habitat use—stored in the otoliths of >2200 fishes. These natural tags revealed that 47-61% of snapper and gag recruits to Alabama reefs originated in Florida panhandle seagrass nurseries. Seagrass meadows in Alabama and Mississippi were also important nurseries for snappers and gag, contributing 26-46% of recruits. Despite high juvenile snapper and gag catches along the extensive Chandeleur Islands, Louisiana, relatively few of those fishes recruited to Alabama’s reefs (<13% of total recruits, across species), although they may have recruited to populations outside our sampling domain. Beyond the applied value of these data for resource management (i.e. interstate connectivity), our findings highlight broadscale drivers of the nursery role of juvenile habitats for coastal marine populations. These factors include: (1) juvenile habitat extent (i.e. extensive Florida panhandle meadows sourced the most recruits for Alabama fisheries); (2) proximity between juvenile and adult habitats (i.e. highest unit-area contribution from Alabama-Mississippi meadows); and (3) unidirectional, alongshore migration of egressing juveniles (i.e. primarily east-to-west movement, enhancing connectivity with Florida panhandle nurseries, and dampening connectivity with Chandeleur nurseries).},

Profiles showed a general decrease in δ13C (median = 1.91‰) and an increase in δ15N (median = 2.42‰) with age. A marked decline in δ13C occurred for all 11 teeth around 9-10 years and again for six individuals around 20 years. After the early twenties the δ13C continued to decline with age for all teeth. These results are consistent with males segregating from natal groups in low latitudes with the onset of puberty between 4 and 15 years and gradually dispersing pole-ward into 13C-depleted temperate waters. Penetration into further depleted, productive high latitudes after the age of 20 might facilitate the spurt of accelerated growth rate observed around this age. Breeding migrations back to lower latitudes were not reflected in the δ13C profiles possibly due to being short compared to the time spent feeding in high latitudes. The timings of marked isotopic change in the δ15N profiles reflect those of the δ13C profiles, suggesting a link between dietary changes and movements. The observed increase in δ15N with age is likely to be caused by a trophic level increase as males grow in size, probably feeding on larger prey. An additional explanation could be that, in the higher latitudes of the North Atlantic, the main prey source is the high trophic level squid Gonatus fabricii. Also, the lower latitudes from where males disperse are depleted in basal 15N. Profiles of δ13C and δ15N in sperm whale teeth gathered from different regions, sexes, and periods in time, could provide a unique way to understand the ecology of this species across different oceans. © 2006 Springer-Verlag.},

   abstract = {Spatial behaviour of fishes in fresh and brackish water ranges in temporal scales between localized diel movements, often associated with foraging and predator evasion, to seasonal or life-cycle related events involving movements between freshwater habitats or freshwater and marine biotopes. Recent technological advances have resulted in dramatic improvements in the range of techniques available for the study of spatial behaviour of freshwater fishes in the natural environment, and broadly may be divided into two categories: capture dependent and capture independent. The former incorporates those methods that rely on sampling marked fish (mark–recapture) or unmarked fish (density estimates, catch per unit effort) over defined scales of time and space in order to derive information on distribution and movement. Captured fish may also be tagged with transmitters that radiate energy, enabling the fish to be tracked and/or environmental data to be gathered. Biochemical analysis of samples from fish, requiring non-destructive sampling (genetic analysis and scale microchemistry) or destructive sampling (otolith microchemistry) may also provide information on migration and ontogenetic processes. Capture independent techniques include visual observation and video techniques, hydroacoustics and automated fish counting. Catch per unit effort and mark–recapture techniques are most efficient where long-term fishery or monitoring studies are in place and data on crude spatial and temporal scales are acceptable. They also have the advantages of low technical requirements and low equipment costs. Where specific management or ecological questions are pertinent, recapture independent techniques may be more appropriate. Telemetric methods can provide high resolution information at the individual level, while hydroacoustics is increasingly providing information at the population level in large lake and river environments. Biochemical methods are becoming increasingly useful in determining the extent of population segregation, where DNA analysis is used, and in the study of migration and ontogenetic changes in behaviour, where otolith microchemistry and stable isotope analysis is used.},

Stomach content analysis identified substantial ontogenetic dietary shifts in all species, corresponding to changes in body size-isotope trajectories for two species. Shifts away from relatively specialised diets of heavily 13C-depleted insect larvae to consumption of a range of items across multiple basal carbon sources appeared to be the proximate cause of observed isotopic changes. 3.Allochthonous organic matter in the form of C3 riparian vegetation was particularly important to smaller terapontids before larger fish shifted to a broad range of dietary items and similarly broad range of basal carbon sources. 4.While there was general agreement between δ 13C and stomach content analysis, there was minimal concurrence between the latter and δ 15N isotopic derivation of estimates of trophic position. Due to factors such as omnivory, isotopically overlapping basal sources and uncertainties about rates of isotopic fractionation in both predator and prey species, stomach content analysis provides an essential complement to isotopic methodologies in tropical systems. 5.Given that basal sources supporting any individual species can change markedly with ontogeny, consideration of intraspecific, size-related variation is necessary in isotopic studies of food web structure. © 2012 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.},

Management actions and operations are typically concentrated on static habitats, or specific areas of interest, without considering movement patterns of species associated with ontogenetic shifts in habitat usage. Generalized additive models were used to model the body-length-habitat relationships of six fish species. These models were used to identify subsets of environmental parameters that drive and explain the continuous length-habitat relationships for each of the study species, which vary in their degree of ecological and/or commercial importance. Continuous predictive maps of the length distributions for each of the six study species across approximately 200 km2 of the study area were created from these models. The spatial patterns in habitat partitioning by individuals of different body lengths for all six study species provide strong evidence for ontogenetic shifts. This highlights the importance of considering ontogenetic processes for marine spatial management. Importantly, predictive hotspot maps were created that identify potential areas that accumulate individuals of similar life stages of multiple species (e.g., multispecies nursery areas). In circumstances where limited resources are available for monitoring and management of fish resources, predictive modelling is a valuable tool for studying previously overlooked processes such as ontogenetic habitat shifts. Predictive modelling provides crucial information that elucidates spatial patterns in community composition across mosaics of benthic habitats. This novel technique can contribute to the spatial management of coastal fish and fisheries by identifying areas that are important for different life history stages of multiple fish species.},

Using controlled laboratory experiments, juvenile black bream, Acanthopagrus butcheri (family Sparidae), were reared for 50 days in aquaria of varying temperatures and salinities using three experimental designs: temperature x salinity, temperature only, and salinity only. Temperature and salinity interacted to significantly affect the elemental concentration ratios of Sr:Ca and Ba:Ca and the concentrations of isotopes δ13C and δ18O in otoliths. The single-factor experiments showed that temperature significantly affected the concentration ratios of Sr:Ca and Ba:Ca and the concentrations of δ13C and δ180 in otoliths, whereas salinity alone did not affect the concentration ratios of any elements but did affect both isotopes. The concentration ratios of Mg:Ca and Mn:Ca varied considerably among fish within the same treatment level and showed little or no effects due to temperature and (or) salinity.

   abstract = {Natural systems are often complex and dynamic (i.e. nonlinear), making them difficult to understand using linear statistical approaches. Linear approaches are fundamentally based on correlation. Thus, they are ill-posed for dynamical systems, where correlation can occur without causation, and causation may also occur in the absence of correlation. “Mirage correlation” (i.e., the sign and magnitude of the correlation change with time) is a hallmark of nonlinear systems that results from state dependency. State dependency means that the relationships among interacting variables change with different states of the system. In recent decades, nonlinear methods that acknowledge state dependence have been developed. These nonlinear statistical methods are rooted in state space reconstruction, i.e. lagged coordinate embedding of time series data. These methods do not assume any set of equations governing the system but recover the dynamics from time series data, thus called empirical dynamic modeling (EDM). EDM bears a variety of utilities to investigating dynamical systems. Here, we provide a step-by-step tutorial for EDM applications with rEDM, a free software package written in the R language. Using model examples, we aim to guide users through several basic applications of EDM, including (1) determining the complexity (dimensionality) of a system, (2) distinguishing nonlinear dynamical systems from linear stochastic systems, and quantifying the nonlinearity (i.e. state dependence), (3) determining causal variables, (4) forecasting, (5) tracking the strength and sign of interaction, and (6) exploring the scenario of external perturbation. These methods and applications can be used to provide a mechanistic understanding of dynamical systems.},

Our estimates of marine recreational catches that are retained and landed increased globally until the early 1980s, stabilized through the 1990s, and began increasing again thereafter, amounting to around 900,000 t⋅year–1 in 2014. Marine recreational catches thus account for slightly less than 1% of total global marine catches. Trends vary regionally, increasing in Asia, South America and Africa, while slightly decreasing in Europe and Oceania, and strongly decreasing in North America. The derived taxonomic composition indicates that recent catches were dominated by Sparidae (12% of total catches), followed by Scombridae (10%), Carangidae (6%), Gadidae (5%), and Sciaenidae (4%). The importance of Elasmobranchii (sharks and rays) in recreational fisheries in some regions is of concern, given the life-history traits of these taxa. Our preliminary catch reconstruction, despite high data uncertainty, should encourage efforts to improve national data reporting of recreational catches.},

First, for precautionary reasons exploitation paths should avoid high fishing mortality in those fisheries where the biomass is depleted to a degree that jeopardise the stock's capacity to produce the Maximum Sustainable Yield (MSY). Second, for economic and social reasons, captures should be as stable (smooth) as possible over time. In this article we show that a conflict between these two interests may occur when seeking for optimal exploitation paths using age structured bioeconomic approach. Our results show that this conflict be overtaken by using non constant discount factors that value future stocks considering their relative intertemporal scarcity.},

   abstract = {Marine fisheries in Brazil follow a similar trend as the rest of the world, with reduced catches of most stocks. Although extensive, the Brazilian coast is poorly assessed, and marine fishery resources are not properly managed. Small pelagic fishes are secondary consumers, which feed on zooplankton and serve as foraging species for large, carnivorous fishes. The anchovy (Engraulis anchoita) is an abundant, small pelagic fish found in abundance in Brazilian waters as it migrates along the Brazilian, Uruguayan and Argentine shelves. In 2010, five acoustic assessment cruises were conducted to estimate anchovy biomass in the southernmost part of the Brazilian coast. Hydroacoustic data were obtained using a SIMRAD EK 500 echo sounder along parallel transects. CTD (conductivity temperature depth) casts and mid-water trawl hauls were used to collect environmental and biological data. Anchovy biomass was estimated using NASC values, the fish target strength by size and the dimension of the surveyed area. For each survey, a GLM binomial was fitted to anchovy presence and the following explanatory variables: surface salinity and temperature, bottom salinity and temperature, and depth. Anchovy biomass ranged between 73,000 (June) and 814,000 (August) tons. We observed a mean temperature decrease of ~3 °C during the June and August surveys. This sharp environmental change was followed by a distinct increase in adult anchovy biomass from the first to the second survey. Fitted GLM models indicated that the bottom layers of cold, saline water had a positive effect on anchovy presence in August but not in June. Furthermore, during the August survey, a sharp change in the surface layer waters was observed on the Southern Brazilian Shelf, as the result of a low-salinity water inflow to this area. This phenomena was due to the Patos Lagoon runoff and also to the coastal winds over the Argentine Shelf, which forces the northward spreading of the Plate River plume to lower latitudes. This inflow increases primary productivity and, subsequently, the occurrence of fishes within the area.},

Comparisons (pemutational multivariate analyses of variance and canonical analysis of principal coordinates) of 78 flounders caught simultaneously at two close localities in Brazil (Cabo Frio and Niteroi) and previously published data of 51 fish from Argentina (Necochea) allowed testing the value of parasite tags as discriminators at both small and large spatial scales. A total of 5925 metazoan parasites belonging to 17 species were found in Brazilian samples. Parasite assemblages varied across localities in terms of species richness and presence and abundance of individual species. Multivariate analyses of presence and abundance of long-lived parasites resulted in clear dissimilarity patterns across all samples. Significant differences were also observed when the entire parasite assemblages were compared between both Brazilian samples. The best discriminator species at both spatial scales were represented by unspecific parasites, broadly distributed among fish species in the region. These indicator species apparently display recurrent spatial patterns across host species, being therefore expected to serve as suitable tags for population studies of other resources. Parasites constitute valuable tools to be included in further holistic stock identification studies, which may eventually allow proactive mitigation and conservation strategies for many short scale artisanal fisheries in the southwestern Atlantic coasts, which are facing severe risks of overexploitation and collapse.},

   abstract = {Thirty years of industrial fishing have led to overexploitation of many species, triggering the urgent need to better assess and manage marine stocks for sustainability. From the very simple definition of stock as "an exploited fishery unit" to its complex delimitation using ecosystem approaches, genetic approaches provide a large number of potential markers to unveil the underlying molecular background of complex biological phenomena in marine species.The present study is a diagnostic assessment of the number of scientific data published in marine fisheries using genetic technologies since the onset of NGS up to 2014. This state of the art approach would allow to derive causalities of real figures and to hypothesize trends in the use and applications of genetic markers. We first briefly overview pros and cons of current technologies used to delineate fish stocks and address intrapopulation knowledge deficits identified under an open population paradigm. Then, in order to assess the advancement of the application of molecular genetic techniques in "fish stock delineation" we review the work published on spatio-temporal structures of fish stocks. Finally, the datamining effort is enlarged across marine fisheries during the period 2004-20014 to decipher the intensity of use of genetic tools per taxa, the main application of each marker type and the trend of use of classic, modern and new generation techniques in fishery research tasks. Although microsatellites and mitochondrial DNA-based markers have being used at a growing pace in fishery research tasks until 2011, a time when application of gene sequencing and NGS-derived markers to fishery research has significantly grown. NGS technologies are underused in fishery science regarding their wide application in other research fields such as agriculture and aquaculture. So a significant increment of new genetic marker types is expected to be implemented in the near future. Conversely, application of classic marker types such as allozymes, AFLPs, whole mitochondrial genomes, RAPDs and RFLPs on mtDNA has been much less used in the period 2004-2014 following the advent of fast and cheap genotypic screening and NGS-derived markers. Power gain afforded from the combination of different genetic markers to address complex processes is lacking in current fishery research since only 21% of the studies over that period employed two genetic marker types and only 3% employed more than two.Combinations of methods would allow addressing management issues such as distribution shifts and population expansion in response to climatic fluctuations and global change, as well as overfishing and fishery collapses.},

Its successful application as a natural tag in stock discrimination studies is based on the ability to distinguish among different groups due to variation in otolith chemical composition. Here, we briefly summarize the history and the development of otolith chemistry in general and their application in stock delineation studies in particular. A short overview of the major achievements in stock identification using otolith chemistry is provided whilst covering the evolution in methodological and analytical approaches over the last decades. Current and future challenges and research gaps are outlined focusing on the need to provide accurate stock structure estimates for management purposes. Overall, there is still large room for improvement regarding how we overcome these challenges and supersede the current gaps in population structure and connectivity studies using otolith chemistry. The most favorable and practical directions for future research are discussed, and include marker integration, new technological and statistical approaches that may contribute in further advancing otolith chemistry and its application in stock delineation. Ultimately, the continued development of holistic approaches combining otolith chemistry with different and potentially complementary techniques is clearly the course of action to promote interconnection between management actions and biological processes, and unambiguously resolve stock structure and scientifically underpin fisheries management.},

Evaluation of analytical tools allows assessing the minimum amount of information needed to properly delineate stock units.

   abstract = {We developed an approach for estimating changes in relative year-class strength of source populations contributing to mixtures by incorporating ages or lengths of mixture individuals in genetic stock identification models. The approach is intended for long-lived fishes with high pre-recruitment and low post-recruitment mortality rates for which consistent temporal changes in recruitment can be assumed. Age- and collection-year specific contributions of sources to the mixture are modeled as linear functions of two source-specific parameters: an intercept representing relative recruitment for the first modeled year class and a slope representing how relative recruitment changes annually. Based on simulations, the estimation approach performed reasonably well under diverse conditions, including varying numbers of sources, levels of genetic divergence among sources, degrees of change in year-class strength, durations and frequencies of sampling from mixtures, age ranges of individuals from mixtures, and sample sizes from mixtures. The estimation approach was also robust to aging error and uncertainty in length-age relationships. We applied the approach to genetic and length data for lake sturgeon Acipenser fulvescens from Green Bay, Lake Michigan, collected from 2002 to 2008, with sources corresponding to five Lake Michigan tributaries. Two of the Lake Michigan sources showed declining recruitment levels, whereas the other three sources showed increasing recruitment levels. We believe our proposed approach for indexing changes in year-class strength shows promise as a tool for identifying sources potentially at risk due to declining recruitment and for relating changes in recruitment to biotic or abiotic factors.},

Herein, we explore biobanking and genetic marker challenges as tools to be used for fish stock discrimination. First of all, we discussed about well-recognized major gaps identified by researchers, managers and end-users that improve the usefulness of parasites as tags. Secondly, we suggest the potential of under-exploited biobanking and molecular markers as promising technical solutions, which could play a future leading role ensuring such a priori high discriminatory power of marine fish populations based on parasite data.},

   abstract = {In principle, the spatial extent of fishery stock assessment should reflect the biological population, and major fishing patterns or population heterogeneity within the area should be represented. However, these theoretical requirements are commonly dismissed in practice, often when there is compelling evidence that spatial scope and structure is mis-specified and without testing if the mis-specified model performs well for informing fishery management. Population dynamics theory, case studies in fishery management as well as simulation tests demonstrate that accurately accounting for spatial structure in stock assessments can improve model performance, and ignoring spatial structure can lead to misperceptions of stock status and failures in fisheries management. Therefore, the development of stock assessment applications should include an evaluation of the most appropriate spatial scope and structure. Some common challenges in defining and modeling spatial structure can be addressed by adopting general best practices, but each species and its fisheries are unique. Accordingly, determining the most appropriate spatial structure involves 1) an interdisciplinary synthesis of all available information to determine the most plausible paradigms of population structure and fishing patterns, 2) the development of spatial operating models that are conditioned on these paradigms, and 3) testing the performance of estimation models and management strategies that are based on the current spatial management unit as well as alternative spatial scopes and structures that reflect population structure and fishing patterns.},

The International Council for the Exploration of the Seas (ICES) advice for the sardine in regions VIII and IXa in 2013 indicated that the biomass has decreased since 2006 and recruitment has been below the long term average since 2005. Recruitment is very variable, so it is important to understand the underlying processes driving this variation in order to manage the fishery effectively. In this study, a biophysical model was used to simulate the early life (egg and larval) stages of sardine. A high resolution hydrodynamic model for North and Northwest Iberia was used to force a Lagrangian Individually-Based Model (IBM) that simulated advection and dispersion (both horizontal and vertical) and included some biological behaviour. A Lower Trophic Level (LTL) model coupled to the hydrodynamic model was also used to get some insight on recruitment for years 2006-2007. Additionally, since in this area there are two different spawning grounds that could be associated with two eventually different populations, we have tried to show how the model can be used for giving insight on stock connectivity and therefore can contribute to stock delineation.},

   abstract = {Southern blue whiting (Micromesistius australis australis) once contributed to one of the largest finfish fisheries in the Southwest Atlantic. Intense exploitation began in the late 1970s with peak total annual catches attaining 258.000 tonnes in 1983. Continuing levels of exploitation hereafter resulted in a significant reduction in its abundance by the early 1990s and forced the implementation of a suite of conservation measures to rebuild these stocks. Improved recruitment levels in recent years suggests that these measures have been effective. However, more information on habitat use and behaviour during the early life history stages of this fish is required to be able to draw firm conclusions. Here, we use complimentary investigations into otolith microstructure and trace elemental composition (by LA-ICPMS) to study the early stages of ontogeny in M. a. australis. We provide evidentiary support for the formation of daily growth increments on the otoliths of juvenile M. a. australis and utilise these to estimate the age at onset and completion of metamorphosis (30.5 ± 0.3 and 60.7 ± 1.8 days after the first increment formation, respectively). The timing of a newly defined ‘juvenile transition-mark’ (corresponding to the transition from the epipelagic larval habitat to a deeper juvenile habitat) was estimated to form at 76.5 ± 2.0 days after first increment formation, suggesting that early juveniles remain in the epipelagic habitat for over two weeks post-metamorphosis. Significant shifts in element:42Ca ratios were found for elements 24Mg, 55Mn, 88Sr and 138Ba between otolith zones corresponding to different ontogenetic stages: (A) larval-, (B) metamorphosis- and (C) juvenile zone. These shifts could be correlated with changes in behaviour and habitat. Elemental ‘fingerprints’ for each of the three otolith zones were found to be distinct through high classification accuracies of the Random Forest classifier (81.1 ± 0.1 %), with 55Mn:42Ca contributing most to the classification. This holistic approach investigating both otolith microstructure and elemental composition provided evidence that ontogeny could be a confounding factor in natal (geographic) origin studies if elements predominantly controlled by physiology are included in the respective classification analyses.},

Therefore, the present study was conducted to delineate the diversity and stock structure of mud crab species based on the 24 morphometric length measurements and 27 morphometric ratios data collected from the three coastal regions (Chittagong, Cox's Bazar and Bagerhat) of Bangladesh. Based on the taxonomic keys, majority of the species (about 82.4%) were identified as S. olivacea, while the remaining (about 17.6%) was S. serrata. In consistent to our preliminary analysis, both the univariate proportion and multivariate analysis of the collected morphometric lengths and ratios data also distinctly divided the mud crabs population into two multivariate spaces as S. serrata and S. olivacea. For the further analysis of the stock structure of these two species, data were subjected to the univariate ANOVA, multivariate ANOVA, Canonical Variate Analysis (CVA), and Principal Component Analysis (PCA) according to their collection sites. Scatter plots of CVA scores between CV1 and CV2 and PCA scores between PC1 and PC2 showed that the individuals of both species clearly made clusters into three multivariate spaces with minimum overlaps according to their collection sites. In morphometric traits Linear Discriminant Function Analysis (LDFA), the average percentage of correctly classified (PCC) into the original groups of the S. olivacea and S. serrata was 100%. For stock discrimination, the average PCC into their original groups of collection sites were 100% and 99% for the S. olivacea and S. serrata, respectively. Finally, dendrogram based on the Euclidean distances consistently separated S. olivacea and S. serrata and stock structures similar to other multivariate analyses. In conclusion, our study shows that S. olivacea is the dominant mud crab species and S. serrata is the minor one, and the stock discrimination of each species should be considered in the management and conservation policy of these species along the coastal region of Bangladesh.},

In this study, carbon and oxygen stable isotopes (δ13C and δ18O) and trace elements (138Ba, 55Mn, 25Mg and 88Sr) were measured in otoliths of young-of-the-year (YOY) and age-1 yellowfin tuna collected from the Mozambique Channel and north-west Indian Ocean regions. Elemental profiles showed variation in Ba, Mg and Mn in YOY otolith composition, but only Mn profiles differed between regions. Differences in YOY near-core chemistry were used for natal-origin investigation. Ba, Mg and Mn were sufficiently different to discriminate individuals from the two regions, in contrast with carbon and oxygen stable isotopes. A linear discriminant analysis resulted in 80% correct classification of yellowfin tuna to their natal origin. Classification success increased to 91% using a random forest algorithm. Finally, a unique larval source was detected among age-1 yellowfin tuna. The signal of these fish resembled that of YOY from a north-west Indian Ocean origin, highlighting the importance of local production. The present study supports the use of otolith chemistry as a promising approach to analyse yellowfin stock structure in the Indian Ocean.},

   abstract = {Sustainable management of wild fisheries requires accurate delineation of reproductively isolated stocks to avoid depletion of a commercially and ecologically important resource. However, there is still a lack of reliable information on stock structure for most fishery species in New Zealand. DNA markers can assist in the delineation of stocks, but they also can provide significant insights into other areas related to the genetic diversity and the response to pressures. In this review, we first provide a detailed summary of the population genetic studies of New Zealand fish species, with a particular focus on hoki, orange roughy, snapper, ling, and blue cod. We find that genetic data is uniformly lacking for most species. We then discuss how the global shift from low resolution markers to genomics in fisheries genetics has far reaching consequences for the sustainable management of our aquatic resources, by allowing us to address multiple important pressures that wild fisheries are currently facing, and we introduce some of these briefly. We conclude by emphasising the need for a more systematic and holistic approach for the use of genomics in New Zealand fisheries management, so that the best evidence is available to inform the decisions of policy makers.},

   abstract = {Delineating the stock structure of highly-mobile, wide-ranging fishes subject to exploitation is a challenging task, yet one that is fundamental to optimal fisheries management. A case in point are stocks of skipjack tuna (Katsuwonus pelamis), yellowfin tuna (Thunnus albacares), bigeye tuna (Thunnus obesus) and albacore tuna (Thunnus alalunga) in the Pacific Ocean, which support important commercial, artisanal, subsistence, and recreational fisheries, and contribute roughly 70 % of global commercial tuna catches. Although some spatial and temporal structuring is recognised within these stocks, growing evidence from a range of approaches suggests that the stock structure of each tuna species is more complex than is currently assumed in both stock assessment and climate change models, and in management regimes. In a move towards improving understanding of the stock structure of skipjack, yellowfin, bigeye and South Pacific albacore tunas in the Pacific Ocean, an international workshop was held in Nouméa, New Caledonia, in October 2018 to review knowledge about their movement and stock structure in the region, define and discuss the main knowledge gaps and uncertainties concerning their stock structure, and develop biological sampling approaches to support the provision of this information. Here, we synthesise the discussions of this latter component. For each tuna species, we identify several general sampling considerations needed to reduce uncertainty, including i) the need for broadscale sampling in space, ideally covering each species’ distribution, targeting adults in spawning condition and adopting a phased approach; ii) the need for temporally-repeated sampling of the same geographical areas to assess stability in observed patterns over time; iii) the need to resolve patterns in spatial dynamics, such as those resulting from movements associated with the seasonal extensions of poleward flowing currents, from underlying stock structure, iv) the importance of adopting a multidisciplinary approach to stock identification, and v) the need for careful planning of logistics and coordination of sampling efforts across agencies. Finally, we present potential sampling designs that could be adopted to help overcome uncertainties around the initial identification of stocks and the provenance, mixing and proportional contributions of individuals in harvested assemblages, as well as how these uncertainties could be accounted for in fisheries management via the use of management strategy evaluation.},

   abstract = {A prerequisite in fisheries management is to identify biological meaningful delineations of stocks, the fundamental exploited units. The European anchovy is one such species in need to better identify stock boundaries. Indeed, despite a spawning aggregation behaviour both in the southern Bay of Biscay and southern North Sea in spring and summer, it has a seemingly continuous distribution in autumn across a broad region ranging from the Bay of Biscay to the northern North Sea including the English Channel, thus with potential mixing of the spawning units. We therefore used genetic markers (single nucleotide polymorphisms) to quantify the degree of gene flow between the currently managed fish stock of the bay of Biscay and northern areas of European anchovy's distribution. Our results confirm the clear distinction between the Bay of Biscay and northernmost populations, with assignment of all English Channel samples to the latter. We also found a clear overall pattern of isolation by distance that resulted primarily from an increasing differentiation with geographic distance in the Northern group magnified by the lack of gene flow with the anchovies of the Bay of Biscay. The small reduction in gene diversity towards northern latitudes may indicate partial isolation of the leading-edge component of the Northern population. Quotient plots relating anchovy's distribution to environmental covariates showed that anchovies sampled in autumn in the English Channel originate from the summer spawning aggregation in the warm, low saline and plankton rich south-eastern North Sea. This change in the seasonal distribution of the northern population mimics, but in opposite direction, the one of the Bay of Biscay where anchovy spread towards the north from the spawning habitat in the south-eastern bay. The encounter, without mixing, of the two populations west of Brittany in autumn suggests strong spawning site fidelity. Finally, we identified for the first time anchovies belonging to the estuarine ecotype in the Loire estuary. Our results therefore support current management units, yet with some uncertainties for the catches in the transition zones between the Bay of Biscay and the English Channel, and within river plumes in the vicinity of estuaries hosting the estuarine ecotype.},

However, the trends in nominal CPUE can be influenced by many factors in addition to stock abundance, including the choice of fishing location and target species, and environmental conditions. Consequently, catch and effort data are usually 'standardized' to remove the impact of such factors. Standardized CPUE for bigeye tuna, Thunnus obesus, caught by the Taiwanese distant-water longline fishery in the western and central Pacific Ocean (WCPO) for 1964-2004 were derived using three alternative approaches (GLM, GAM and the delta approach), and sensitivity was explored to whether catch-rates of yellowfin tuna and albacore tuna are included in the analyses. Year, latitude, and the catch-rate of yellowfin explained the most of the deviance (32-49%, depending on model configuration) and were identified consistently among methods, while trends in standardized catch-rate differed spatially. However, the trends in standardized catch-rates by area were found to be relatively insensitive to the approach used for standardization, including whether the catch-rates of yellowfin and albacore were included in the analyses. © 2007 Elsevier B.V.

   abstract = {Ocean acidification is of particular concern for vulnerable larval stages or marine organisms that are critical to population replenishment and connectivity. In fishes, the existing body of ocean acidification research has focused mostly on small demersal species, which may be more resistant to acidification than less well-studied offshore pelagic species. A better understanding of the effects of ocean acidification on these understudied species requires examination of biological factors that influence larval ability to successfully survive, navigate, and recruit to adult populations. This dissertation reports a series of studies researching the impact of ocean acidification on the larval stages of two widely distributed, pelagic, tropical fish species, cobia (Rachycentron canadum) and mahi-mahi (Coryphaena hippurus). Larvae were raised for up to 21 d under several projected acidification scenarios, including scenarios for year 2100 (800 "mu"atm pCO2), year 2300 (1700-2100 "mu"atm pCO2), comparative worst-case scenarios (up to 5400 "mu"atm pCO2), and multi-stressor experiments crossing acidification with increased temperature and starvation stress. Treatment effects were evaluated throughout ontogeny using selected metrics including larval growth, size, development (flexion), swimming ability (Ucrit), swimming activity, and otolith (ear stone) formation. Additionally, novel in situ analysis of otoliths using three-dimensional micro-computed tomography and subsequent modeling of otolith mechanical function was performed to evaluate potential ocean acidification impacts to the auditory sensitivity and hearing range of larval fish in a high-CO2 ocean. Collectively, this research provides unprecedented perspective on the potential impacts of ocean acidification on two valuable pelagic fish species and identifies promising areas for future research.},

Annual increments from scales (n = 541) and daily increments from sagittal otoliths (n = 107) were examined; estimated von Bertalanffy parameters were L∞ (asymptotic length) = 1299 mm FL and k (growth coefficient) = 1.08/yr. Daily growth increments reduced much of the residual error in length-at-age estimates for age-0 dolphinfish; the estimated average growth rate was 3.78 mm/day during the first six months. Size at 50% maturity was slightly smaller for female (460 mm FL) than male (475 mm FL) dolphinfish. Based on monthly length-adjusted gonad weights, peak spawning occurs from April through July off North Carolina; back-calculated hatching dates from age-0 dolphinfish and prior reproductive studies on the east coast of Florida indicate that dolphinfish spawning occurs year round off the U.S. east coast and highest levels range from January through June. No major changes in length-at-age or size-at-maturity have occurred since the early 1960s, even after substantial increases in fishery landings.},

All the fish analysed (5 males and 15 females) were at spawning stage, except the smallest female (61.5 cm in fork length), which might not have yet reached sexual maturation. The oceanographic conditions during the samplings were similar to those occurring during the peak spawning season in the Gulf of Mexico.

Life-history variables, migratory behaviour, and genetic markers have been used to define major stocks in the central Atlantic Ocean and Mediterranean Sea. Here, we used the mitochondrial DNA gene NADH subunit 1 (688 bp) to test for differences between population groups. A total of 103 haplotypes were detected among 203 fish. Gene diversities in samples were large and similar among populations (mean h = 0.932; range 0.894-0.987), but nucleotide diversities varied widely among samples (range π= 0.004-0.034) and appear to reflect population histories. Principal component analysis revealed two large populations groups, and the analysis of molecular variation and pairwise values of φST resolved population structure within these groups. Populations in the eastern Atlantic and Mediterranean showed the largest amounts of divergence from one another (φCT = 0.331). Adult movement and biophysical barriers to larval dispersal may explain contemporary differences between stocks, but the divergent populations in the Mediterranean Sea are likely due to isolations by cold temperature barriers during Pleistocene glaciations. The geographically large stock groupings require international cooperation in the harvest management and conservation of local dolphinfish populations.},

   abstract = {Many ecologically important fishes, including mahi-mahi (Coryphaena hippurus), and their offspring were directly exposed to crude oil following the Deepwater Horizon (DWH) oil spill. Early life stage fish are especially vulnerable to the toxicity of crude oil-derived polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). In teleosts, yolk sac proteins are the main energy source during development and are usually catabolized into ammonia or urea among other byproducts. Although excretion of these waste products is sensitive to oil exposure, we know little about the underlying mechanisms of this process. In this study, we examined the effects of crude oil on ammonia and urea handling in the early life stages of mahi. Mahi embryos exposed to 30–32 μg L−1 ∑PAH exhibited increased urea excretion rates and greater accumulation of urea in the tissues before hatch suggesting that ammonia, which is highly toxic, was converted into less-toxic urea. Oil-exposed embryos (6.3–32 μg L−1 ∑PAH) displayed significantly increased tissue ammonia levels at 42 hpf and upregulated mRNA levels of ammonia transporters (Rhag, Rhbg and Rhcg1) from 30 to 54 hpf. However, despite increased accumulation and higher expression of ammonia transporters, the larvae exposed to higher ∑PAH (30 μg L−1 ∑PAH) showed reduced ammonia excretion rates after hatch. Together, the increased production of nitrogenous waste reinforces previous work that increased energy demand in oil-exposed embryos is fueled, at least in part, by protein metabolism and that urea synthesis plays a role in ammonia detoxification in oil-exposed mahi embryos. To our knowledge, this study is the first to combine physiological and molecular approaches to assess the impact of crude-oil on both nitrogenous waste excretion and accumulation in the early life stages of any teleosts.},

As the oil dispersed it contaminated ecosystems that support numerous Gulf species including mahi-mahi (Coryphaena hippurus). The timing of the spill, and location of the surface slick, coincided with the spawning of many species in the region, raising concerns over embryonic and larval exposure. Numerous abnormalities due to crude oil exposure have been documented in fish early life stages, including cardiotoxicity; however, knowledge of the molecular mechanisms that cause these phenotypes is still limited. Several transcriptomic studies have presented cholesterol biosynthesis as one of the top enriched pathways following PAH exposure. In this study we exposed mahi-mahi embryos to DWH oil collected from the surface slick. At exposures ranging from ∑PAH 1.69 μg/L to ∑PAH 5.99 μg/L, the resulting larvae demonstrated significant increases in farnesyl-diphosphate farnesyltransferase 1 (fdft1) and an upward trend in 3-Hydroxy-3-Methylglutaryl-CoA Reductase (hmgcr) expression, genes that encode key enzymes in the cholesterol biosynthetic pathway. In addition to the increased expression of genes in cholesterol biosynthetic pathway, a significant decrease in total cholesterol was observed in larval homogenates, at ∑PAH 8.3 μg/L. These data confirm earlier transcriptomic studies and show that oil may diminish cholesterol and adversely impact numerous cellular functions due to altered membrane stability.},

To test this, we compared the chemistry of otolith nuclei from Patagonian toothfish (Dissostichus eleginoides), presently managed as spatially discrete populations corresponding to fishing management areas along the Antarctic Circumpolar Current (ACC), which transports water eastward around the Southern Ocean. The chemistry of otolith nuclei, laid down during early life, differed significantly between fishing areas off South America and the Antarctic and between some Antarctic areas. However, we found significant discrepancies from expectation for a population structure corresponding to fishing areas. We also found evidence of four groups of fish with different early life chemistry: one associated with South America and three Antarctic groups showing mixing consistent with advective transport along the ACC. These results suggest that toothfish populations are structured by their physical environment; population abundance and persistence may rely on a restricted number of breeding members with access to spawning grounds, whereas fisheries may rely substantially on nonbreeding vagrants transported from fishing areas upstream. © 2008 NRC.},

Otolith edge signatures proved to be a valuable tool for classifiying individuals to the collection locations. Individuals were assigned to three different groups in the Atlantic Ocean and in the Mediterranean Sea based on otolith core values using nonmetric multidimensional scaling.

The significant differences in the isotopic signatures of P. multidens demonstrated that there is unlikely to be substantial movement of fish among these distinct adult assemblages. The stable isotopic signatures for the fish from the different locations were persistent through time, and therefore it could be concluded that the fish comprise separate stocks for many of the purposes of fisheries management. The ratios of the stable oxygen isotopes in P. multidens were significantly related to sea surface temperatures (r2 = 0.797).

Oxygen isotopes showed enrichment in 18O in otolith carbonate with salinity (0.10: Δ δ18O/Δ salinity ‰) typical for the evaporation of seawater. The enrichment in 13C (up to 1.75‰) was attributed to the incorporation of metabolically derived CO2 from an enrichment of 13C in the food web within Shark Bay. This was possibly a result of lower concentrations of dissolved CO2 with increasing salinity causing a reduction in isotope fractionation during photosynthesis.

   abstract = {For stock assessment purposes, Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua) from the coastal and offshore regions off northern Norway is usually allocated to Norwegian coastal cod (NCC) or Northeast Arctic cod (NEAC) by internal morphological features of their otoliths. As this classification is subject to individual interpretation by otolith age readers, this study investigated an alternative objective approach for the separation of the two cod groups, using otolith shape analysis. Several hundred otolith samples from coastal fjord areas along northern Norway and from the Barents Sea were analysed by univariate shape descriptors and elliptical Fourier analysis (EFA). When combining uni- and multivariate descriptors and applying the otolith reader typing as reference, the classification score was 89% for NCC and 90% for NEAC. These results indicate that the internal morphology of the otoliths, evaluated by the age readers, is translated to a great extent to their outer morphology and that otoliths can be allocated to NCC and NEAC by their shapes with high certainty. When genetic typing data (Pan I marker) were used as reference, the classification scores were reduced to 83% for NCC and 76% for NEAC when combining uni- and multivariate descriptors and excluding heterozygotes. This implies that differences in otolith morphology cannot directly be linked to genetic structure. Differences in environmental conditions, however, seem to have a considerable influence on how otolith growth increments and consequently otolith shapes are formed. As the various fjord systems in Norway provide local habitats and as differences within the NCC with regard to genetic structure and life-history parameters had been found in earlier studies, variation of NCC otolith shapes between three coastal regions was also examined. The region classification scores for reader-typed NCC varied between 60% and 81%. © 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

   abstract = {The 18O/16O and 13C/12C ratios in the otolith carbonate of pink snapper Pagrus auratus and tailor (bluefish) Pomatomus saltatrix, from several locations along the Western Australian coast, indicated that pink snapper stocks are location specific but that tailor stocks are less so. The hypersaline Shark Bay, on the coast of Western Australia, generated strongly characteristic isotopic signatures which serve as natural tags. Otolith carbonate from pink snapper from normal oceanic waters just north of Shark Bay showed no evidence that the fish had been in hypersaline water. Similarly, pink snapper from the hypersaline bay showed no evidence of having spent time at normal oceanic salinity. By contrast, some tailor from oceanic waters showed evidence of having spent considerable time in the bay, and some fish from the bay had oceanic signatures. This suggested that tailor were more migratory than snapper. The similarity in the distribution of the isotopic signatures (from oceanic to hypersaline) in otolith carbonate from tailor from oceanic waters north of Shark Bay (Koks Island), and from those within Shark Bay, indicated a single stock in this region (in contrast to pink snapper). Moreover, tailor from coastal south-western Australia and from the Shark Bay area could be considered separately for some management purposes. For pink snapper stocks from oceanic waters, oxygen isotope signatures were clearly related to water temperature although the temperature relationship was obscured for fish within Shark Bay because of the strength of the signal generated by the hypersaline water. For tailor the temperature relationship was not obvious, probably because migrations of tailor smeared the temperature effect, and the hypersaline Shark Bay waters dominated, and, possibly, at the southern extremity of the range, the freshwater in some estuaries influenced the isotopic signatures of the otolith carbonate. Strontium/calcium ratios in pink snapper otoliths also indicated a separation of stocks, but for tailor overlap of signatures again suggested migratory behaviour.},

Otolith chemistry of Atlantic bluefin tuna (Thunnus thynnus) was quantified to assess the feasibility of using these natural tags to discriminate juveniles (age 0 and age 1) from putative nurseries. A suite of six elements (Li, Mg, Ca, Mn, Sr and Ba) was measured in whole otoliths using solution-based inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry. Otolith chemistry of age-1 T. thynnus collected from the two primary nurseries in the Mediterranean Sea and western Atlantic Ocean differed significantly, with a cross-validated classification accuracy of 85%. Spatial and temporal variation in otolith chemistry was evaluated for age-0 T. thynnus collected from three nurseries within the Mediterranean Sea: Alboran Sea (Spain), Ligurian Sea (northern Italy), and Tyrrhenian Sea (southern Italy). Distinct differences in otolith chemistry were detected among Mediterranean nurseries and classification accuracies ranged from 62 to 80%. Interannual trends in otolith chemistry were observed between year classes of age-0 T. thynnus in the Alboran Sea; however, no differences were detected between year classes in the Tyrrhenian Sea. Age-0 and age-1 T. thynnus collected from the same region (Ligurian Sea) were also compared and distinct differences in otolith chemistry were observed, indicating ontogenetic shifts in habitat or elemental discrimination. Findings suggest that otolith chemistry of juvenile T. thynnus from different nurseries are distinct and chemical signatures show some degree of temporal persistence, indicating the technique has considerable potential for use in future assessments of population connectivity and stock structure of T. thynnus.},

Otoliths were measured by traditional one- and two-dimensional measures (otolith length, width, area, perimeter, circularity, and rectangularity), as well as by Fourier analysis to capture the finer details of otolith shape. Variables were compared among four regions of the GBR separated by hundreds of kilometers, as well as among three reefs within each region, hundreds of meters to tens of kilometers apart. The temporal stability in otolith structure was examined by comparing two cohorts of fully recruited four-year-old P. leopardus collected two years before and two years after a significant disturbance in the southern parts of the GBR caused by a large tropical cyclone in March 1997. Results indicated the presence of at least two stocks of P. leopardus, although the structure of each stock varied depending on the cohort considered. The results highlight the importance of incorporating data from several years in studies using otolith morphology to discriminate temporary and possibly misleading signals from those that indicate persistent spatial structure in stocks. We conclude that otolith morphology can be used as an initial step to direct further research on groups of P. leopardus that have lived at least a part of their life in different environments.},

A large part of a plastic bowl and a tuna pectoral fin were the only items recorded in the fish stomach. The plastic measured 99.57 cm2 and weighed 12.77 g, likely blocking the digestive tract and reducing food intake by the fish, as supported by signs of starvation. This is the record of the largest plastic debris ingested by a dolphinfish to date. As the source of the plastic container was probably a tuna fishing boat, we suggest strengthening environmental education programs to enhance the awareness of fishermen and mitigate the impacts of plastic pollution on the pelagic ecosystem and associated organisms, such as C. hippurus.},

The scales (n = 69) removed from six different regions of the body were examined and those from the caudal region exhibited greater morphological regularity, symmetry and a smaller rate of regeneration. The regression between caudal scale radius (RS) and LF displayed was linear (LF = 28·334 RS + 9·186; r2 = 0·754). Otolith micro-increments were counted assuming daily periodicity. Ages estimated from otoliths ranged from 64 to 659 days. The von Bertalanffy growth model was fitted based on the otolith readings generating L∞ = 194·1 cm LF, k = 0·912 year−1 and t0 = 0·081 years. Species longevity was estimated to be c. 4 years. Ninety-eight per cent of the overall sample was adult specimens well above the age of first maturity in the study area. The large variability between scale length and LF and the failure to ascertain increment deposition periodicity suggest that scales are not appropriate for ageing C. hippurus and analysis of otolith micro-increments is deemed the best structure for ageing this species in the study area.},

   abstract = {Fish otolith morphology has been closely related to landmark selection in order to establish the most discriminating points that can help to differentiate or find common characteristics in sets of otolith images. Fourier analysis has traditionally been used to represent otolith images, since it can reconstruct a version of the contour that is close to the original by choosing a reduced set of harmonic terms. However, it is difficult to locate the contour's singularities from this spectrum. As an alternative, wavelet transform and curvature scale space representation allow us to quantify the irregularities of the contour and determine its precise position. These properties make these techniques suitable for pattern recognition purposes, ageing, stock determination and species identification studies. In the present study both techniques are applied and used in an otolith classification system that shows robustness against affine image transformations, shears and the presence of noise. The results are interpreted and discussed in relation to traditional morphology studies. © CSIRO 2005.},

Movements from Florida to the South-Atlantic Bight (SAB) (44.67 ± 39.53. km/d) and Florida to northeastern North Carolina (MAB) (44.62 ± 15.31. km/d) had the highest observed rates, while movements within the SAB were the slowest (11.80 ± 27.94 km/d). Regional movement headings varied with latitude, with dolphinfish released from Florida Keys to Central Florida displaying the most directional variability, with 3.5% conducting southerly movements. The majority of the southerly movements occurred during fall. The maximum straightline dispersal rate was 238.25. km/d and the greatest displacement distance was 1915. km observed in 51 days between the Florida Keys and Long Island, New York. Understanding the movements of dolphinfish along the U.S. east coast is the first step toward better predicting seasonal and annual stock abundances by state and elucidating state-to-state stock connectivity.

Results showed that it is possible to count daily growth rings in the sagittae, mainly on the pararostrum zone. Seasonal growth rings were not detected, that is, longer than daily periodicity. We consider that this method is ideal to identify daily growth rings in young organisms. As specimen age and the amplitude of the growth rings diminish, these rings can be underestimated because they appear to overlap. The Gompertz growth model best described the first growth phase (L0= 7.02, G= 3.04, g= 2.89), and the von Bertalanffy constants were: L∞= 231.65 cm, Wc ∞= 77.926 kg, K= 0.874, t0= 0.074.

However, age determination is invariably accompanied by various sources of error, some of which can have a serious effect on age-structured calculations. This review highlights the best available methods for insuring ageing accuracy and quantifying ageing precision, whether in support of large-scale production ageing or a small-scale research project. Included in this review is a critical overview of methods used to initiate and pursue an accurate and controlled ageing program, including (but not limited to) validation of an ageing method. The distinction between validation of absolute age and increment periodicity is emphasized, as is the importance of determining the age of first increment formation. Based on an analysis of 372 papers reporting age validation since 1983, considerable progress has been made in age validation efforts in recent years. Nevertheless, several of the age validation methods which have been used routinely are of dubious value, particularly marginal increment analysis. The two major measures of precision, average percent error and coefficient of variation, are shown to be functionally equivalent, and a conversion factor relating the two is presented. Through use of quality control monitoring, ageing errors are readily detected and quantified; reference collections are the key to both quality control and reduction of costs. Although some level of random ageing error is unavoidable, such error can often be corrected after the fact using statistical (' digital sharpening ') methods.},

Comparisons were confined to two dominant cohorts of age 4+ and 13+ years, spawned in winter 2002 and 1993 respectively. Otolith shape varied significantly between the WTAS and GAB regions for the age 4+ cohort only. Cu:Ca of otolith cores was significantly higher for both cohorts from WTAS than EBS and GAB, and Ba:Ca of otolith cores higher for WTAS and EBS than the GAB region. Stable isotopic signatures showed greater variation among regions for the age 13+ cohort. In particular, otoliths of age 13+ fish from WTAS displayed significantly higher δ 18O (indicative of lower temperature history) than age 4+ fish from all regions, and the same age fish from the GAB and EBS regions. δ 18O of blue grenadier otoliths accurately predicted water temperature at their main capture depths of 400-600m. Chemistry of otolith cores combined with whole otolith isotope ratios discriminated GAB and EBS samples from those collected on the known WTAS spawning ground with moderate to high (64-86%) accuracy. The results provide support for the hypotheses that the GAB fishery is based on a separate stock for management purposes, and that the EBS fishery is likely replenished both from local spawning and the major WTAS spawning region. © 2011.},

Although there is increasing evidence that stocks of European conger eel are in decline, there is little published material on the population structure or management of the species. Stable isotope ratios, namely δ18O and δ13C, measured by standard mass spectrometric techniques in whole otolith samples of juvenile conger eels sampled in April/May 2006 from NE Atlantic (Azores, Madeira and North Portugal) and Mediterranean (Mallorca) exploited stocks provided location-specific signatures. Isotopic ratios for conger eel were similar to those reported for other marine species (δ18O‰, mean±SE: 1.64±0.04, 1.87±0.02, 1.26±0.03, 2.41±0.02 and δ13C‰: -1.78±0.08, -2.09±0.07, -3.43±0.15, -2.73±0.12, respectively for North Portugal, Azores, Madeira and Mallorca). Relationships between isotopic ratios (δ18O and δ13C) and otolith mass were not significant. Seawater temperature could partially explain the differences in δ18O of otoliths among the fishery locations. The δ18O signatures of the Portuguese mainland coastal specimens were, however, lower than expected values, possibly as a result of the freshwater input of the Douro River located in the vicinity of this fishery area. The inter-site variation of carbon isotopic signatures was likely related to slight differences in diets or DIC of the water. The distinct isotopic signatures suggest low levels of connectivity between the fishing grounds and that conger eels are relatively sedentary during the juvenile phase. Isotopic signatures in the otoliths of C. conger clearly discriminated between the NE Atlantic and the Mediterranean fishery areas providing support for treatment of these fisheries as different management units. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

   abstract = {Dolphinfish (Coryphaena hippurus) is used by many coastal countries. Sustaining harvest of this resource will require cooperation among fishing countries in each region, and determining population structure is paramount to ensuring effective management. Examining life-history parameters (such as growth rate) is a useful and relatively inexpensive method for identifying possible stock units, which can be subsequently confirmed by other methods. The purpose of this study is two-fold. First, we examine the two-stock assumption for Taiwanese dolphinfish and the reliability of estimated growth curves based on seasonally-stratified growth performance indices. The von Bertalanffy growth functions (VBGF) were firstly estimated from 2005 to 2009 length frequency sample data of eastern and southern coasts of Taiwan. New growth performance indices were then calculated from the log-transformed parameters of the VBGF and examined by a simultaneous confidence region (SCR) under the assumption of bivariate normal distribution. Second, we summarize VBGF parameter estimates from all regions worldwide and based on the growth parameters and performance indices, review the possible stock structures and the reliability of growth estimations for dolphinfish. The results support a single-stock hypothesis for dolphinfish in the Kuroshio Current off Taiwan with new estimated VBGF parameters of L∞=149.4cm and K=0.72year-1. Some potentially biased estimates of dolphinfish growth parameters are identified in the worldwide VBGF dataset and are suggested for further investigations. Excluding these estimates, the results indicate at least a five-stock structure in the Pacific and the Atlantic oceans. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

Despite this, little attention has been paid to conducting biological stock assessments and developing management strategies for this species, and it remains unmanaged across most of the region. This paper summarizes aspects of the biology of dolphinfish that are relevant to assessment and management from studies of this species in the southeastern United States, Gulf of Mexico and the Caribbean. Throughout their range in the western central Atlantic, dolphinfish are seasonally abundant and presumed to be highly migratory. They exhibit high growth rates, early maturity, batch spawning over an extended season, a short life span and a varied diet. Marked differences in some biological characteristics and in the frequency of IDH-2 alleles between dolphinfish from the southeastern USA and the Caribbean suggest a relatively complex stock structure for this species, which needs further investigation to improve the information base for development of management strategies for dolphinfish across this region.},

   abstract = {The growth and reproductive characteristics of dolphinfish Coryphaena hippurus collected in the waters off western Kyushu from May 2008 to April 2011 were determined based on scale and otolith readings and gonad histological examinations, respectively. Based on annual increments in scales and daily increments in sagittal otoliths, the von Bertalanffy growth curves in male and females were determined as FLt = 1049[1-exp\{-0.835(t+6.975 ×10-14\}] andFLt = 938[1-exp\{-1.029(t+6.975 ×10-14\}] respectively, where FLt is the mean fork length (mm) at age t. The spawning period was found to last from June to August for dolphinfish, based on an examination of the monthly changes in the gonadosomatic index and histological observations. Therefore, based on the relationship between the fork length and the developmental stage of the testes or ovaries, male and female dolphinfish were found to reach sexual maturity by the following spawning season after hatching in the northern East China Sea. © 2012 The Japanese Society of Fisheries Science.},

   abstract = {Negative impacts of CO2-induced ocean acidification on marine organisms have proven to be variable both among and within taxa. For fishes, inconsistency confounds our ability to draw conclusions that apply across taxonomic groups and highlights the limitations of a nascent field with a narrow scope of study species. Here, we present data from a series of 3 experiments on the larvae of mahi-mahi Coryphaena hippurus, a large pelagic tropical fish species of high economic value. Mahi-mahi larvae were raised for up to 21 d under either ambient seawater conditions (350 to 490 µatm pCO2) or projected scenarios of ocean acidification (770 to 2170 µatm pCO2). Evaluation of hatch rate, larval size, development, swimming activity, swimming ability (Ucrit), and otolith (ear stone) formation produced few significant effects. However, larvae unexpectedly exhibited significantly larger size-at-age and faster developmental rate during 1 out of 3 experiments, possibly driven by metabolic compensation to elevated pCO2 via a corresponding decrease in routine swimming velocity. Furthermore, larvae had significantly larger otoliths at 2170 µatm pCO2, and a similar but non-significant trend also occurred at 1200 µatm pCO2, suggesting potential implications for hearing sensitivity. The lack of effect on most variables measured in this study provides an optimistic indication that this large tropical species, which inhabits the offshore pelagic environment, may not be overly susceptible to ocean acidification. However, the presence of some treatment effects on growth, swimming activity, and otolith formation suggests the presence of subtle, but possibly widespread, effects of acidification on larval mahi-mahi, the cumulative consequences of which are still unknown.},

   abstract = {The dolphin grows rapidly throughout its life. Check marks believed to be annuli were formed from November through February. Average growth was 725 mm fork length the first year and 450 mm the second year. One older fish belonged to age-group III (1425 mm long), and another to age-group IV (1525 mm). A male dolphin in the reef tank of the Miami Seaquarium, Miami, Florida, grew from about 0.5 kg (one lb.) to 16.3 kg (36 lb.) in about eight months. Maximum life span is probably about four years. Male dolphin longer than about 450 mm were heavier than females of the same length. Reproduction was studied by gross observation of the gonads, measurements of egg diameters, and counts of maturing eggs. Changes in the gonads through the year indicated that the spawning season in the Florida Current extends from November through July and is at its peak in March. Female dolphin begin to mature at 350 mm fork length, and all are mature by 550 mm. Males begin to mature at a slightly larger size. Female dolphin produce 80,000-1,000,000 eggs at each spawning and spawn twice (perhaps as many as three times) per year.},

The counting of annual increments from dorsal spines of >65 cm FL dolphinfish at X25 magnification (n = 47) permitting an age reading resolution in years, and the counting of daily increments from sagittal otoliths of <65 cm FL dolphinfish at X400 magnification (n = 583) permitting an age reading resolution in days, were estimated; the von Bertalanffy growth model applied to these fish gave the following parameters: L∞ = 107.8 cm FL and 120.2 cm FL, and K = 1.9 yr<sup>-1</sup> and 1.56 yr<sup>-1</sup>, for males and females respectively. The maximum age observed was 2 years. Size at 50% maturity for fish 10-131 cm FL (n = 1376) was 58.9 cm FL and 62.5 cm FL for males and females, respectively. The sex ratio for the fish sampled from the FAD fishery (10.5-131 cm FL) was 1:1.54 (M:F) and for dolphinfish sampled from the surface longline fishery (91-130 cm FL) was 1:0.76 (M:F). Back-calculated hatch dates from age-0 dolphinfish (n = 518) suggested that spawning occurs from June to September with the highest levels in June. This study is the first to use dorsal spines to determine the age of adult dolphinfish.},

   abstract = {The size, growth and spawning characteristics of pompano dolphin (N=150) and common dolphinfish (N=36) caught off the Canary Islands between May and September 1995 and between July and September 1996 were examined. Fork length (FL) of pompano dolphin was in the range 28.3-62.8 cm. In 1995, the mean length increased significantly from June to September. However, in 1996, the mean length was significantly larger in July than in September. The overall length-weight relationship was W=0.0287*FL2.774 (r=0.97), while these relationships by sex were as follows: W=0.031*FL2.758 (r=0.98) and W=0.0282*FL2.776 (r=0.97), for males and females respectively. Spawning takes place at the beginning of the Summer (June-July). All the individuals obtained showed developing gonads, but females showed a higher gonadosomatic index (GSI) than males. The highest GSI values were obtained in June (x̄ = 3.10±1.73), and decreased progressively towards the end of the season (September), when the average of this index was x̄ = 1.86±0.87. Similarly, the condition index decreased significantly from June to September. The proportion of females was always significantly higher than males, except in July 1996 when it was 1:1. There was a high correspondence between growth rates determined by annuli scale interpretation and modal progression analysis. According to scale annuli interpretation, the individuals caught showed more than five age classes. However, there are doubts about age assignation from scales. Fork length of common dolphinfish was in the range of 76.5-103.0 cm. The length-weight relationship obtained for all the specimens caught was W=0.00095FL3.527 (r=0.96), while these relationships by sex were as follows: W=0.00398FL3.222 (r=0.94) and W=0.0165FL2.873 (r=0.91), for males and females respectively. Spawning probably takes place at the beginning of the Summer. All the individuals obtained showed developing gonads, although the GSI of females were higher than males. The highest GSI values were obtained in June (x̄ = 5.50±2.17). In the same way, the condition index decreased from May to June. The proportion of females was always slightly higher than males (1:1.4), but the ratio was not significantly different from 1:1.},

   abstract = {The dolphinfish (Coryphaena hippurus) is a highly migratory pelagic species commercially exploited by industrial, artisanal and recreational fisheries in tropical and subtropical areas of the world’s oceans. Herein, we evaluated the dolphinfish industrial fishery in Pacific Panama for the first time generating a growth model and examining fluctuations in annual total catch and in catch per unit effort (CPUE) over a four-year period (2006-2009). Annual and monthly catch values and biological parameters of 14 913 individuals were obtained onboard industrial vessels, landing sites and records from processing plants. Size frequency for industrial vessels showed a normal distribution between 353 and 1 715 mm (average, 1 010.85 mm; n = 10 459). Fish weight averaged 4.94 kg (SD). Sex ratio was slightly biased toward females. More than 90% of the analyzed fish were sexually mature. The length-weight relationship was positive and significant, reflecting allometric growth. Growth parameters using the von Bertalanffy equation revealed a growth efficiency of θ = 4.61, which is within the reported range for Coryphaena hippurus (3.95-4.70). The largest fish were between age classes 2 and 3 (700-1 400 mm). Total catch per year and catch per unit effort (CPUE) per year fluctuated, with the highest values recorded between 2008 and 2009. Catch values reported herein are preliminary and appear to be below those recorded elsewhere in the region and cautiously may represent an indicator of sustainable use of this marine resource even considering the absence of management actions in Panama.},

   abstract = {The shape of sagittal otoliths from the dolphinfish (Coryphaena hippurus) was studied to test the hypothesis that two stocks exist off the northeast coast of Brazil. In all, 82 sagittal otoliths were collected from fish caught by the artisanal fleet in two coastal regions of northeastern Brazil in December 2003 and April/May 2004. Several shape descriptors were determined [area, perimeter, rectangularity, circularity, eccentricity, fractal dimension (FD), and Fourier coefficients (FCs)] to evaluate the degree of similarity in the otoliths between regions. A three-morphotype pattern was revealed through cluster and principal component analyses based on FCs of the 30th harmonics. Apparently, this pattern is not influenced by clinal factors. Despite the great variability between otolith shapes, separation of the samples from two regions was suggested using multivariate and univariate analyses of variance for all shape descriptors and using canonical discriminant analysis. The methods successfully classified 57.1 and 69.6% of otoliths from the Maranhão and Rio Grande do Norte regions, respectively. The FD was a powerful descriptor in discriminating the two stocks. Differences in the shapes of sagittal otoliths may be related to different growth rates of the species and lend credence to the belief that there are two stocks along the Brazilian coast. © 2008 International Council for the Exploration of the Sea.

   abstract = {The age and growth of dol- phin, Coryphaena hippurus, has been determined in wild specimens between 14.4 and 124 cm fork length (FL) caught off Majorca (Balearic Islands, western Mediterranean). Also, several methods have been applied to validate the re- sults obtained and to assess the aging techniques presently used. In accor- dance with the sexual dimorphism of this species, the length–weight rela- tionship showed negative allometry in females and isometry in males. The high correlation between increment counts and known age in 75 reared lar- vae from 0 to 38 days old (number of increments = 0.3894+0.9846·days of age; r=0.98) indicated that the daily deposition of growth increments in sag- ittal otoliths and regular incremental formation begins on day one. This cor- relation validated the use of otoliths in the aging of 176 juvenile specimens between 16.5 and 58.5 cm FL, in which the minimum and maximum ages ob- served were 47 and 176 days, respec- tively. Nevertheless, the progressive increase in complexity with the onto- genic development of these structures suggests that this method may under- estimate age in adult fish, probably owing to the loss of marginal zones of the otolith during the polishing process. Thus, from 150 specimens between 65 and 124 cm FL, the interpretation of annuli from scales gave ages up to 3 years old, whereas readings of otoliths in 36 specimens of the same size inter- val gave ages between 0 and 1 year old. Growth parameters were calculated from the age–length relationships of otolith and scale readings in juvenile and adult fish, respectively, and from the analysis of monthly length-fre- quency distributions, obtained in 1990 and 1991 during the exploitation of ju- veniles from 18 to 70 cm FL (n=4084). The values obtained for L∞ ranged from 72.4 cm FL in unsexed juveniles and 110.0 cm FL in females both juvenile and adult, whereas k ranged from 1.6/year in juvenile and adult females and 2.5/year in unsexed juveniles. Although the re- sults obtained were quite different ow- ing to the different length and age range considered, similar results were obtained by comparing the growth per- formance index (F), and showed the rapid growth of the species.},

In 1995 however, commercial landings in the Atlantic Ocean of the southeastern U.S. were almost twice the weight of the previous years.

Sexual dimorphism was observed, males from 50 cm fork length developing a vertical forehead. The sex ratio was 1:1. Fish smaller than 25 cm fork length were predominantly females, while males were more abundant over 115 cm fork length. The composition of each sex during the study period was around 50% except in December, when females were clearly predominant. A high proportion of fishes caught by long line were mature and showed gonadosomatic values higher than those obtained from surrounding net catches, in which there were only immature fish. Nevertheless, hepatosomatic index and condition factor did not show any specific trend related to the spawning condition. The size at which the population attain 50% maturity was 54.5 cm fork length in females, and 61.8 cm fork length in males. In 14 pre-spawning females, the relative fecundity ranged from 71 to 197 eggs g-1, with a mean value of 120 ± 31.3 eggs g-1. The size distribution of oocytes, with at least two groups of oocytes in the ovaries, suggests that C. hippurus is a multiple spawner, with an extended spawning season in the study area.},

All dolphinfish released in the northeastern Caribbean Sea moved westward (274.42° ± 21.06°), but slower in the tropical Atlantic than Caribbean Sea, with a maximum straight-line distance recorded between San Juan, Puerto Rico, and Charleston, South Carolina (1917.49 km); an 180-day geolocation track was obtained connecting the South Atlantic Bight to the northern limits of the Mona Passage. Two recaptures occurred within the Mona Passage from San Juan, Puerto Rico, and St. John, United States Virgin Islands, providing the first evidence that dolphinfish may cross the Greater Antilles island chain between the Atlantic Ocean and Caribbean Sea in both directions during their migration. To investigate this further, fish movements were compared to surface drifter tracks (n = 196) in the region. Entry of drifters into the Caribbean Sea from the Atlantic Ocean occurred through the northern Lesser Antilles, the Anegada Passage, and the Mona Passage; both passages were observed to be an entry and exit. Results suggest domestic and international fisheries exchanges occur annually between the United States and Caribbean island nations (Antigua and Barbuda, Anguilla, St. Kitts, United States Virgin Islands, Puerto Rico, Hispaniola, The Bahamas, Cuba, Bermuda), with return migration directed towards the Yucatan Channel/Loop Current (south of the Greater Antilles) or Straits of Florida/Gulf Stream (north). Understanding dolphinfish movements and regional connectivity among exclusive economic zones of northern Caribbean islands and the United States is critical for accurate assessments of fishing mortality, spawning biomass and stock health, and given the regional connectivity, management must be consistent between jurisdictions.},

   abstract = {This paper presents data to support the presence of (1) intra-annual signals in the chemical composition (δ18O and Sr/Ca) of the skeletons of sclerosponges from the Bahamas and (2) variable rates of skeletal accretion. These conclusions are based on data obtained by using a microsampling method for the stable oxygen and carbon isotopes in which material was extracted at a resolution of one sample every 34 μm and a laser microprobe which obtained trace element data every 20 μm (Sr, Mg, and Pb). An age model was established using a combination of changes in the concentration of Pb, the change in the δ13C of the skeleton of the sclerosponges, and U/Th isotopic measurements. These methods yield a mean growth rate of 220 μm/yr but suggest that the growth rate in this particular sclerosponge was not constant. The calculated growth rate is within error identical to that determined by U/Th methods. The variable growth rate was confirmed through spectral analysis of the δ18O and Sr/Ca data that showed peaks corresponding to the annual cycle in these parameters as well as peaks corresponding to growth rates of approximately 128, 212, 270, and 400 μm/yr. The presence of these additional frequencies suggests a growth rate between approximately 100 and 300 μm/yr. These conclusions were supported by modeling of oxygen isotopic data measured on a scleractinian coral as well as model isotope data generated on synthetic time series. These findings have important implications for the use of sclerosponges as proxies of paleoclimate because they emphasize the need for a precise yearly chronology in order that proxy data can be compared with climatic variables.},

The overall recapture rate for dolphinfish released within The Bahamas was 2.7% (n = 33) for fish that ranged in size from 45 to 122.5 cm FL [81.87 (SD 21.84) cm FL]. Days at liberty (DAL) averaged 23.03 (SD 20.60) d (range 0-77 d) and movement speeds (range 0-19.93 km d-1) and headings were dependent upon the location of tagging. Linear displacements ranged from 0 to 1903.16 km. Movements within The Bahamas were to the south in the Tongue of the Ocean, Northeast Providence Channel, and Exuma Sound, ranging from 4 to 23 DAL. However, the majority of dolphinfish released in the Tongue of the Ocean showed little net dispersal (<1 km) after 5-77 DAL. Emigration from The Bahamas occurred most frequently for fish released north of Great Abaco and Eleuthera Islands; fish were recaptured from near Cape Canaveral, Florida, to southeast of George's Bank after 14-58 DAL. Recapture patterns when compared to drifter tracks suggest dolphinfish migrate in a circuit around the western central Atlantic to The Bahamas, but paths can vary widely in temporal and spatial scale. These observations are potentially key for understanding inter-Regional dolphinfish movements and stock structure between exclusive economic zones in the western central Atlantic and Caribbean Sea. © 2014 Rosenstiel School of Marine & Atmospheric Science of the University of Miami.},

A portion of the mitochondrial nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH) dehydrogenase subunit 1 (ND1; 1288 base pairs) gene was used at 2 spatial scales to investigate the population structure of dolphinfish. In a comparison of 183 specimens of dolphinfish between the northern and southern coasts of Puerto Rico over 4 consecutive years (2010–2013), no genetic differentiation was detected (ΦST= −0.002, P=0.640). On a broader scale, patterns of genetic variation of ND1 were compared for samples collected throughout the western central Atlantic from Florida, South Carolina, North Carolina (southeastern United States; N=90); Puerto Rico (northeastern Caribbean Sea; N=183); Barbados, Dominica, and Trinidad and Tobago (eastern Caribbean Sea; N=43); and the central North Atlantic in the Azores Islands (N=8), and 199 haplotypes were identified from all of the regions combined. Analysis of all samples (N=324) revealed shallow genetic structure (Φ<inf>ST</inf>=0.009, P=0.023), but pairwise regional comparisons did not, indicating low population differentiation of dolphinfish throughout the western central Atlantic.},

   abstract = {Dolphinfish, Coryphaena hippurus, is a widely distributed epipelagic species that migrates seasonally in different areas of the oceans. In Venezuelan and adjacent waters it is fished commercially mainly by artisanal fishermen using surface longline and gillnet. Information on effort, location, catch at size, weight and sex determination from 1991 to 1997 was used to determine the seasonality of the demographic structure of dolphinfish off Venezuela. A total of 4876 specimens were measured and sexed from port sampling and observer-covered trips in longline vessels. Oocyte development and spawning season were estimated from samples collected in observer-covered trips on board longline vessels. The seasonality of dolphinfish off Venezuela appears to show two different size groups: one arriving at the end of the first quarter comprised of large mature individuals that will spawn in May, and one arriving at the beginning of the third quarter comprised of smaller specimens that will spawn in October-November. Sex ratio at size was significantly biased towards females in all quarters for smaller specimens (<100 cm FL), while males were predominant in larger size classes (>120 cm FL). Oocyte development revealed an indeterminate spawning pattern, as shown by the asynchronous oocyte development in the material examined. A reproductive strategy is proposed based on the seasonal movement pattern of dolphinfish off Venezuela, which is used to ensure recruitment success due to the prevailing environmental conditions off the Venezuelan coasts.},

The two most important dynamic oceanographic variables were sea surface temperature and chlorophyll-a concentration. We also used catch and release locations of dolphinfish caught by recreational fishermen (2002-2007) to compare conditions between datasets and for model evaluation. Dolphinfish CPUE was highest at 22-25°C with a peak at 24°C for the longline dataset, while recreational dolphinfish were caught in waters >19°C with peak catches occurring at 27°C. Dolphinfish CPUE was highest when chlorophyll-a concentration was <0.2mgm-3, and the majority of recreational dolphinfish were captured in waters <0.1mgm-3 with a peak at 0.02mgm-3. We also found that a majority (73.26%) of recreational dolphinfish were caught in association with Sargassum spp., and larger dolphinfish (>82.3cm FL) are caught more frequently outside of the floating mats. © 2014 The Authors.},

One group that often provokes diseases in otherwise normal subjects (fungi of parasitic-pathogenic character) and a second group that causes diseases in cases of lowered immunobiological resistance (fungi of saprophytic-opportunistic character). Though the biological conditions of the host are important, they are by no means the only prerequisites for the development of a mycosis. Just as important are the enzymatic qualities of the fungus. Ubiquitous moulds can become opportunists and provoke dermatoses under two conditions: (1) The fungus must possess keratolytic capabilities (2) its penetration and growth must be preceded by a lesion due to trauma, or bacterial or viral infection.},

This new relationship has been obtained using high-resolution δ18O data measured in sclerosponges from the Bahamas and Jamaica compared to ambient temperature measurements and δ18O values of seawater from the two locations, both measured and published. New data improve an existing calibration which was determined using measurements of salinity rather than directly measured δ18O values of the seawater and was composed of measurements from different species of sclerosponge and other aragonite-secreting organisms. The updated calibration (n = 12, r2 = 0.95) is: T (° C) = 16.1 (± 3.1) - [6.5 (± 1.1)] (δarag - δsw), where T is temperature in degrees Celsius, δarag is the δ18O value of aragonite normalized to VPDB, and δsw is the δ18O value of water normalized to VSMOW. This calibration improves accuracy and precision of Caribbean sclerosponges for reconstructions of temperature as well as δ18O values of seawater. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Age-3 and older fish were estimated to have been fully vulnerable to fishing mortality and to have experienced a total instantaneous mortality rate of 1.04/year, which equals about 65% annually. Legal size limits in directed striped bass fisheries appear to have provided some protection to age-2 fish, which were only partially vulnerable to fishing mortality. The portion of total mortality due to fishing could not be estimated unconditionally because the numbers of striped bass taken in fisheries not directed at striped bass were unknown. An eggs-per-recruit model was developed to provide a conceptual framework for comparing the effects of fishery management options, such as reductions in bycatch or fishing mortality, on the striped bass population.},

   abstract = {When performing habitat models, modellers have to choose between presence-absence and presence-only models to estimate the habitat preferences of a species. Primarily, this choice depends on the data that are available and whether effort data are recorded in parallel to sighting data. For species that are rare or scarce, the models have to address a great number of zeros (i.e., no animal seen) that weakens the ability to make sound ecological inferences. We tested two types of habitat models (presence-absence vs. presence-only) to determine which type best dealt with datasets containing an excess of zeros, and we applied our models to a sighting dataset that included the common (Delphinus delphis) and striped (Stenella coeruleoalba) dolphin (approximately 92% zeros). We used two types of presence-absence models (Generalised Additive models – GAMs, Generalised Linear Model – GLM) and one presence-only model, a MaxEnt model, and we used various criteria to compare these models (i.e., AIC, deviances, rootograms and distribution patterns predicted by the models). Overall, we observed that the presence-absence models made better predictions than the presence-only model. Among the presence-absence models, the GAM with a Negative Binomial distribution was better at predicting small delphinids habitats, even though the GAM with a Tweedie distribution exhibited similar results. However, the zero-inflated Poisson distributions exhibited less convincing results and was contrary to what was expected. Finally, despite 92% zeros, our dataset was not zero-inflated. Our study demonstrates the importance of selecting appropriate models to make reliable predictions of habitat use for species that are rare or scarce.},

They relate similarly to the longevity-related life-history traits (LRLHTs), but studies using information-generating equations and describing such relationships convey three conflicting perceptions. Perception 1 is that h and the compensation ratio decrease as longevity increases and are highest in short-lived, high-productivity species. This perception, usually believed to be inherent in the definition of steepness, is not substantiated by the very definition and, hence, theoretically is wrong. Perception 2 is that h and the compensation ratio increase with longevity and are highest in long-lived, low-productivity species; this perception may occur when the relationships between natural mortality and other LRLHTs are strong, and is most likely correct. Perception 3 is that h and the compensation ratio are independent of LRLHTs; this perception may be caused by the lack of the relationships between natural mortality and other LRLHTs, and is a distortion of perception 2.},

   abstract = {Analysis of spawning biomass per-recruit has been widely adopted in fisheries management. Fishing mortality expressed as spawning potential ratio (SPR) often requires a reference point as an appropriate proxy for the fishing mortality that supports a maximum sustainable yield—FMSY. To date, a single generic level between F30% and F40% is routinely used. Using records from stock assessments in the RAM Legacy Database (RAMLD), we confirm that SPR at MSY (SPRMSY) is a declining function of stock productivity quantified by FMSY. We then use general linear models (GLM) and Bayesian errors-in-variables models (BEIVM) to show that SPRMSY can be predicted from life-history parameters (LHPs, including maximum lifespan, age- and length-at-maturation, growth parameters, natural mortality, and taxonomic Class) as well as gear selectivity. The calculated SPRMSY ranges from about 13% to 95% with a mean of 47%. About 64% of the stocks in the RAMLD require SPRMSY > 40%. Modelling SPRMSY reveals that LHPs plus Class explain 61% of the deviance in SPRMSY. Faster-growing, low-survival, and short-lived species generally require a high SPR. With equal LHPs, elasmobranchs require about 20% higher SPRMSY than teleosts. When FMSY is estimated from fisheries that harvest older fish, increasing the vulnerable age by one year leads to about an 8% increase in SPRMSY. The BEIVM yields smaller variance and bias than the GLM. The models developed in this study could be used to predict SPRMSY reference points for new stocks using the same LHPs for calculating Fx%, but without knowledge of the stock-recruitment parameters.},

Conventional AI is generally calculated by summing the catch per unit of effort (CPUE) weighted by the size of each fishing area. However, CPUE data has many missing values owing to annual changes in operational fishing areas, and this can lead to a considerable bias in the estimated AI. To obtain an unbiased AI, a multivariate auto-regressive state-space (MARSS) model was used to estimate and interpolate missing values in a spatially arranged, long-term bottom-trawl CPUE dataset for yellow seabream Dentex hypselosomus and largehead hairtail Trichiurus japonicus in the East China Sea. As expected, increasing the number of analyzed fishing grids improved interpolation accuracy, but remarkably increased the time required for the analysis. Reducing the maximum number of expectation–maximization (EM) iterations in the maximum likelihood procedure was an effective way to practically reduce analysis time, while keeping the accuracy of the estimation. Thus, this EM-reduction MARSS model was applied to the entire CPUE datasets of yellow seabream and largehead hairtail to address the annual shifts in their AIs and their seasonal migration.},

We compare alternative candidate reference points in terms of their utility and potential performance as limit or target reference points in risk-avthe Magnuson-Stevens Act state that Councils should adopt a precautionary approach to specification of Optimum Yield (OY), and list three features which characterize this approach: 1.) target reference points such as OY should be set safely below limit reference points (such as the Maximum Sustainable Yield, MSY); 2.) stocks at sizes below the level that produces MSY should be harvested at lower rates than stocks at sizes above the level that produces MSY; 3.) as uncertainty about stock status or productive capacity increases, target catch levels should be more cautious. The guidelines indicate limit reference points which include a maximum fishing mortality rate which produces MSY and minimum stock size thresholds from which a stock could be rebuilt to MSY within ten years.

   abstract = {Visible implant elastomer (VIE) was evaluated for marking yearling rainbow trout Oncorhynchus mykiss. The rate of tag detection after the yearlings had been at large for 35 months was also compared with the detection rate found in a subsequent year-class that had been marked as fingerlings and had been at large for 29 months. Fish were marked in the postocular adipose eyelid tissue and on the ventral surface of the lower jaw and examined in the dark under ultraviolet light. Detection rates for both year-classes ranged from 29% to 33%, based on the proportion of fish with two detectable marks. Because the marks were not easily recognized, we believe the detection rates were overestimated. We conclude that detection of VIE at the sites we chose was problematic for the strain of rainbow trout we marked. More favorable long-term detection rates in other species suggest that poor detection rates may be unique to heavily pigmented strains of rainbow trout.},

The ratio of the fished to unfished magnitude of P is the spawning potential ratio (SPA) and is a measure of the impact of fishing on the potential productivity of a stock. Currenluse of SPR merges concepts developed to quantify the compensation required for population persistence given anthropogenic increases in mortality with observations of stock productivity and SSBR for fisheries in the Western North Atlantic. It has a firm theoretical basis and is evaluated against yield per recruit and contrasted with pther traditional biological reference points. SPR is widely used in U.S. fisheries managed under the Magnuson Fishery Conservation and Management Act, usually in the context of a percentage of the unflShed SSBR. lis implementation is intended to be risk-aversive through selection of minimum acceptable levels above which stocks maintain acceptable productivity. The behavior of the underlying principles suggests SPR values below about 0.2 should be avoided unless thare is evidence for exceptionally strong density-dependence in the stock. Critical levels have typically been set in the range of 0.2 to 0.3 primarily based upon the experience in the northwest Atlantic.},

   abstract = {Shoal bass Micropterus cataractae are endemic to the Apalachicola River system in Alabama, Georgia, and Florida, USA. Despite maintaining popular fisheries, little is known about their biology and ecology. Fecundity of this species was estimated from the lower Flint River, Georgia, to better understand egg production of this species and relation with length and weight. Further, these data were used to estimate the spawning potential ratio (SPR) of this population under the current 305-mm minimum-length limit (MLL) and a more restrictive 381-mm MLL. An age-structured model was used to examine changes in yield and SPR across a range of exploitation at three levels of natural mortality. Fecundity of shoal bass ranged from 909−35,502 oocytes with a mean estimate of 10,424 ± 1089 (SD), and increased with length (r2 = 0.46; P < 0.0001), weight (r2 = 0.51; P < 0.0001), and age (r2 = 0.59; P < 0.0001). Thus, nonlethal measures of length or weight of field-collected fish may be used to predict the potential of each fish to contribute a large number of eggs to a hatchery operation. Regression equations derived in this study suggested that hatchery operations may be streamlined by utilizing fish at least 457 mm in length or 1482 g in weight to maximize number of oocytes collected per fish, as these fish should have fecundities higher than the median. Population dynamics modeling predicted that at the lowest estimate of natural mortality, growth overfishing would occur once exploitation exceeded 30 % under the 305-mm MLL, but not under the 381-mm MLL. There was little difference between MLLs at higher levels of natural mortality. At all three levels of natural mortality, the 381-mm MLL did a better job at protecting SPR than the 305-mm MLL, which only approached the 0.20 level at exploitations higher than 60 %. When adjusted for recruitment variability at expected levels of exploitation, SPR at the lowest level of natural mortality approached the 0.20 level during periods of poor recruitment under the 305-mm MLL. Given that the critical level of SPR is unknown for shoal bass, managers should protect this important fishery by adopting a more stringent regulation.},

   abstract = {We used simulation modeling to identify the conditions of growth and recruitment overfishing that were associated with a decline in the Upper Mississippi River (UMR) commercial fishery for channel catfish Ictalurus punctatus prior to 1984, when the minimum length limit was increased from 330 to 381 mm total length. The spawning potential ratio (SPR) - an index developed by marine fisheries scientists to identify and prevent recruitment overfishing - is simply a ratio of the average lifetime production of mature eggs per recruit in a fished population to what it would have been if the population had never been fished. We identified a critical minimum SPR that could be used as a biological reference point in the management of a highly exploited channel catfish fishery. Simulation modeling predicted that the SPR, which ranged from 3% to 12% under the 330-mm minimum length limit, would increase to 10-20% with a 381-mm minimum length limit for exploitation rates of 45-80%. Our predicted increase in the SPR corresponded well to the three- to fourfold increase in age-0 channel catfish abundance. Prior to the higher length limit, the reduction in commercial yield was primarily due to recruitment overfishing and not growth overfishing. The critical minimum SPR of 10-20% for the UMR channel catfish population is lower than the critical levels of 20-30% typically reported for pelagic marine species and is likely due to the life history characteristics and spawning strategy of channel catfish.},

Static MPs established a catch limit at the outset of a projection time period and were not modified thereafter, which reflected their use as interim measures while data collection is improved. Conversely, adaptive MPs recursively adjusted catch limits, which reflected their longer-term use where data-poor circumstances are unlikely to improve. On average, adaptive MPs provided comparable performance over the short term, but had superior performance over the long-term and when stocks were considered moderately to heavily depleted. Our results highlight depletion as a critical quantity in establishing sustainable catches from historical catch observations. We reconfirm that depletion-based MPs are improvements over catch scalar methods that are widely used in US data-poor circumstances and we examine the value in obtaining updated depletion estimates to improve catch sustainability in data-poor circumstances.},

   abstract = {Local ecological knowledge (LEK) can be a valuable approach to fill in knowledge gaps in data-limited systems. Recent research has aimed to make LEK more quantitative-a key step to better integration of LEK into fisheries science and management. Here, we used LEK to a) quantify changes in bonefishing quality over time in South Florida as perceived by members of the flats fishery, and b) demonstrate the applicability of a life history calendar approach to LEK quantitative data collection. In an online survey, we asked anglers and guides to quantitatively evaluate changes in the quality of bonefishing, as a function of bonefish number and size, over the past 40 years in Biscayne Bay, Florida Bay, and the Florida Keys. Results showed a perceived 56% decrease in bonefish number, and a 45% decline in bonefish size since 1975. Respondents reported a decline in bonefish numbers that preceded the decline in size, with numbers starting to decline over 1985–1995, and size by 2005. In terms of the pattern of decline, bonefish number showed a heterogeneous pattern, with a slower rate of decline in 1985–2005 and an accelerated rate over 2005–2010, whereas the size decline was homogenous over 2000–2015. Overall, the study provides additional resolution, spatial coverage, and support to the pattern of bonefish population decline in the region, illustrating the utility of quantitative approaches to LEK data collection, and highlighting the value of integrating multiple knowledge sources to fully characterize ecological patterns.},

We use cobble beaches as a model system to discuss the consequences of this disparity on translational ecology.

The article offers a three-point argument to approach this question. First, people and environment need to be considered together, as social (human) and ecological (biophysical) subsystems are linked by mutual feedbacks, and are interdependent and co-evolutionary. These integrated systems of humans and environment (social-ecological systems) provide an appropriate unit of analysis. Second, the resilience approach deals with change in multilevel complex systems, and has stimulated much of the adaptive governance literature by addressing uncertainty and adaptation to unforeseen future changes. Third, there is a need to foster collaborative approaches to improve social and institutional learning, as for example in adaptive management, collaborative learning networks, and knowledge co-production. Collaborative learning is perhaps where further research, experimentation, and application might make a difference for operationalizing adaptive governance, with a focus on institutions, at all levels from local to international.},

   abstract = {Global overfishing indicates a need to define fisheries sustainability thresholds and identify social factors promoting successful management, but rates of fishing and factors mediating sustainability over long timescales are largely unknown. Here, we reconstruct fisheries yield for the entire period of human habitation (five to seven centuries) for two coral reef ecosystems with substantially different fisheries histories (Florida Keys and the Hawaiian Islands) and evaluate the management strategies associated with periods of sustainable fishing. This involved a mixed methods approach, in which we estimated yield by fishery sector (commercial, subsistence, recreational and aquaculture) and characterized management strategies associated with periods of sustained high yields. We found differences between the two locations, with Hawai'i sustaining yields of more than 12mtkm-2 for four centuries prior to the arrival of Europeans. This period was characterized by adaptive management whose design and enforcement exhibited characteristics of common property resource governance systems, and which effectively protected reef habitat, vulnerable life-history stages for fish, and species with high susceptibilities to overfishing. Reefs in both Florida and Hawai'i were exploited intensively after European contact, with sequential export-driven depletion evident in Florida over the past century. Today, both exhibit strikingly similar modern catch levels, with landings exceeding 10mtkm-2 and evidence of overfishing. Our results demonstrate that management strategies and social institutions that support strict enforcement by a local rule-making authority have had substantial impacts on fisheries yields in the past and suggest that long-term sustainability of fisheries is possible, although rare today. © 2012 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.},

Landings then declined in 1991 and 1992. Commercial and recreational landings data and responses to mail surveys have supplied important information regarding Florida's shark fisheries. The sandbar shark Carcharhinus plumbeus and the blacktip shark C. limbatus accounted for 84% of the sharks landed in the commercial fishery in 1989. Commercially fished sharks are captured primarily by longline gear. After 1986, sharks were targeted much more frequently in the commercial fishery.

   abstract = {Generalized linear models (GLM) and generalized additive models (GAM) were used to standardize catch per unit fishing effort (CPUE) of Ommastrephes bartramii for Chinese squid-jigging fishery in Northwest Pacific Ocean. Three groups of variables were considered in the standardization: spatial variables (longitude and latitude), temporal variables (year and month) and environmental variables, including sea surface temperature (SST), sea surface salinity (SSS) and sea level height (SLH). CPUE was treated as the dependent variable and its error distribution was assumed to be log-normal in each model. The model selections of GLM and GAM were based on the finite sample-corrected Akaike information criterion (AICC) and pseudo-coefficient (Pcf) combined P-value, respectively. Both GAM and GLM analysis showed that the month was the most important variable affecting CPUE and could explain 21. 3% of variability in CPUE while other variables only explained 8. 66%. The interaction of spatial and temporal variables weakly influenced the CPUE. Moreover, spatio-temporal factors may be more important in influencing the CPUE of this squid than environmental variables. The standardized and nominal CPUEs were similar and had the same trends in spatio-temporal distribution, but the standardized CPUE values tended to be smaller than the nominal CPUE. The CPUE tended to have much higher monthly variation than annual variations and their values increased with month. The CPUE became higher with increasing latitude-high CPUE usually occurred in 145°E-148°E and 149°E-162°E. The CPUE was higher when SST was 14-21°C and the SLH from -22 cm to -18 cm. In this study, GAM tended to be more suitable than GLM in analysis of CPUE. © 2009 Chinese Society for Oceanology and Limnology, Science Press and Springer Berlin Heidelberg.},

   abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein−protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-α-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 Å for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21% with default Glide SP settings to 58% with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63% success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40% of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

Reliable and accurate catch per unit effort (CPUE) plays a significant rule in Pacific saury stock assessment. Many statistical models have been used in the previous CPUE standardization research. Here, we compare the performance of Generalized Linear Models (GLMs) and Generalized Additive Models (GAMs) using CPUE data collected from Chinese saury fishery in the Northwest Pacific Ocean from 2003 to 2017 (excluding data from Chinese Taipei), and evaluate the influence of spatial, temporal, environmental variables and vessel length on CPUE. Optimal GLM/GAM models were selected using the Bayesian information criterion (BIC). Explained deviance and 5-fold bootstrap cross-validation results were used to compare the performance of the two model types. Fitted GLMs accounted for 21.57% of the total model-explained deviance, while GAMs accounted for 38.95%. Predictive performance metrics and 5-fold cross-validation results showed that the best GAM performed better than the best GLM. Therefore, we recommend GAM as the preferred model for standardizing CPUE of Pacific saury in the Northwest Pacific Ocean.},

The global conservation crisis demands that managers marshal all available datasets to inform conservation management plans for depleted species, yet the level of trust placed in local knowledge remains uncertain. This study compares four methods for inferring species distributions of an internationally traded, rare and depleted genus of marine fishes (Hippocampus spp.): the use of (i) fisher interviews; (ii) government research trawls, (iii) scientific diving surveys, and (iv) citizen science contributions. We analyzed these four datasets at the genus and individual species levels to evaluate our conclusions about seahorse spatial occurrence, diversity of species present and the cost effectiveness of sampling effort. We found that fisher knowledge provided more information on our data-poor fish genus at larger spatial scales, with less effort, and for a cheaper price than all other datasets. One drawback was that fishers were unable to provide data down to the species level. People embarking on conservation endeavors for data-poor species may wish to begin with fisher interviews and use these to inform the application of government research, scientific diving, or citizen science programs.},

   abstract = {Many migratory species, from monarch butterflies to wildebeest, express partial migration, where only a subset of a population migrates. This intraspecific variation is likely to have large ecological consequences. We studied the ecological consequences of partial migration in a salmonid fish, Oncorhynchus mykiss, in coastal streams in California, USA. One ecotype, steelhead trout, migrates to the ocean, whereas the other, rainbow trout, completes its lifecycle in freshwater. Migration has a strong genetic basis in O. mykiss. In one stream, we found differences in the frequency of migration-linked genotypes below and above a waterfall barrier (migratory allele frequency of 60% below vs. 31% above). Below the waterfall, in the migratory-dominated region, the density of young fish (<1 yr old) was approximately twice that in the resident-dominated region above the waterfall (0.46 vs. 0.26 individuals/m2, respectively), presumably reflecting the higher fecundity of migratory females. Additionally, there were half as many older fish (>1 yr old) in pools downstream of the waterfall (0.05 vs. 0.13 individuals/m2). In a second stream, between-year variation in the dominance of migratory vs. resident fish allowed us to explore differences in fish density and size structure through time, and we found a consistent pattern. In brief, when migratory genotypes dominated, we found higher densities of young fish and lower densities of older fish, resulting in a simpler size structure, compared to when resident genotypes dominated. Moreover, large resident trout had a slightly higher trophic position than young fish (3.92 vs. 3.42 in one creek and 3.77 vs. 3.17 in the other), quantified with stable isotope data. The difference in fish size structure did not generate trophic cascades. Partial migration is widespread among migratory populations, as is phenotypic divergence between resident and migratory forms, suggesting the potential for widespread ecological effects arising from this common form of intraspecific variation.},

   abstract = {Population structure, distribution, abundance and dispersal arguably underpin the entire field of animal ecology, with consequences for regional species persistence, and provision of ecosystem services. Divergent migration behaviours among individuals or among populations are an important aspect of the ecology of highly mobile animals, allowing populations to exploit spatially or temporally distributed food and space resources. This study investigated the spatial ecology of lake sturgeon (Acipenser fulvescens) within the barrier free Huron-Erie Corridor (HEC), which connects Lake Huron and Lake Erie of the North American Laurentian Great Lakes. Over 6 years (2011–2016), movements of 268 lake sturgeon in the HEC were continuously monitored across the Great Lakes using acoustic telemetry (10 years battery life acoustic transmitters). Five distinct migration behaviours were identified with hierarchical cluster analysis, based on the phenology and duration of river and lake use. Lake sturgeon in the HEC were found to contain a high level of intraspecific divergent migration, including partial migration with the existence of residents. Specific behaviours included year-round river residency and multiple lake-migrant behaviours that involved movements between lakes and rivers. Over 85% of individuals were assigned to migration behaviours as movements were consistently repeated over the study, which suggested migration behaviours were consistent and persistent in lake sturgeon. Differential use of specific rivers or lakes by acoustic-tagged lake sturgeon further subdivided individuals into 14 “contingents” (spatiotemporally segregated subgroups). Contingents associated with one river (Detroit or St. Clair) were rarely detected in the other river, which confirmed that lake sturgeon in the Detroit and St. Clair represent two semi-independent populations that could require separate management consideration for their conservation. The distribution of migration behaviours did not vary between populations, sexes, body size or among release locations, which indicated that intrapopulation variability in migratory behaviour is a general feature of the spatial ecology of lake sturgeon in unfragmented landscapes.},

We provide the first insights into partially diadromous migration of grey mullet (Mugil cephalus) in Australia by examining the otolith chemistry of old individuals (aged 7–10 years) from two regions on the east coast. Strontium and Barium concentrations were measured across the otolith using laser ablation inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (LA-ICP-MS) and indicated considerable diversity in migratory histories among individuals. Only 15% of individuals made repeated movements from estuaries to the marine environment, consistent with the annual spawning run in the region. The remainder either made irregular movements between salinity environments (70%), or resided in estuaries or fresh water for their entire life following the early juvenile stage (15%). The patterns are consistent with ‘skipped spawning’ partial migration, where a proportion of the mature population forgoes spawning each year. If confirmed, the behavior may afford the east coast population of M. cephalus some resilience to fishing pressure on the annual spawning run.},

Overall, 94, 250 valid detections were received. Winter flounder remained inshore, and 89% of the total detections occurred between May and October when bottom water temperature exceeded 15°C. Residency in Shinnecock Bay was dependent on time of release and varied greatly from a few weeks to more than 6 months; total presence (number of days on which individual fish were detected within the bay) averaged 22. 0 d (range = 1-132 d). Tracked winter flounder were classified as exhibiting three movement patterns: (1) inner bay movements (short term versus long term), (2) dispersal to offshore waters, and (3) connectivity to other inshore areas. The first two patterns were consistent with historical notions of spatially overlapping resident and migratory individuals, whereas fish that displayed the third pattern may have exhibited a larger home range. These results provide insight into winter flounder movements, residency, and stock structure in a coastal bay of Long Island and provide important information for management. The interaction of exploitation and divergent migration behaviors may be a factor contributing to the winter flounder's decline in Long Island bays; however, more work will be required to obtain a full understanding of the spatial behavior and stock structure of this species. © American Fisheries Society 2011.},

   abstract = {Animal movement comes in a variety of 'types' including small foraging movements, larger one-way dispersive movements, seasonally-predictable round-trip migratory movements, and erratic nomadic movements. Although most individuals move at some point throughout their lives, movement patterns can vary widely across individuals within the same species: differing within an individual over time (intra-individual), among individuals in the same population (inter-individual), or among populations (inter-population). Yet, studies of movement (theoretical and empirical alike) more often focus on understanding 'typical' movement patterns than understanding variation in movement. Here, I synthesize current knowledge of movement variation (drawing parallels across species and movement types), describing the causes (what factors contribute to individual variation), patterns (what movement variation looks like), consequences (why variation matters), maintenance (why variation persists), implications (for management and conservation), and finally gaps (what pieces we are currently missing). By synthesizing across scales of variation, I span across work on plasticity, personality, and geographic variation. Individual movement can be driven by factors that act at the individual, population, community and ecosystem level and have ramifications at each of these levels. Generally the consequences of movement are less well understood than the causes, in part because the effects of movement variation are often nested, with variation manifesting at the population level, which in turn affects communities and ecosystems. Understanding both cause and consequence is particularly important for predicting when variation begets variation in a positive feedback loop, versus when a negative feedback causes variation to be dampened successively. Finally, maintaining standing variation in movement may be important for facilitating species' ability to respond to future environmental change.},

   abstract = {One of the most pervasive themes in ecology is that biological diversity stabilizes ecosystem processes and the services they provide to society, a concept that has become a common argument for biodiversity conservation. Species-rich communities are thought to produce more temporally stable ecosystem services because of the complementary or independent dynamics among species that perform similar ecosystem functions. Such variance dampening within communities is referred to as a portfolio effect and is analogous to the effects of asset diversity on the stability of financial portfolios. In ecology, these arguments have focused on the effects of species diversity on ecosystem stability but have not considered the importance of biologically relevant diversity within individual species. Current rates of population extirpation are probably at least three orders of magnitude higher than species extinction rates, so there is a pressing need to clarify how population and life history diversity affect the performance of individual species in providing important ecosystem services. Here we use five decades of data from Oncorhynchus nerka (sockeye salmon) in Bristol Bay, Alaska, to provide the first quantification of portfolio effects that derive from population and life history diversity in an important and heavily exploited species. Variability in annual Bristol Bay salmon returns is 2.2 times lower than it would be if the system consisted of a single homogenous population rather than the several hundred discrete populations it currently consists of. Furthermore, if it were a single homogeneous population, such increased variability would lead to ten times more frequent fisheries closures. Portfolio effects are also evident in watershed food webs, where they stabilize and extend predator access to salmon resources. Our results demonstrate the critical importance of maintaining population diversity for stabilizing ecosystem services and securing the economies and livelihoods that depend on them. The reliability of ecosystem services will erode faster than indicated by species loss alone. © 2010 Macmillan Publishers Limited. All rights reserved.},

In this paper, what is known about the causes and consequences of partial migration in fishes is reviewed. Firstly, the ultimate and proximate drivers of partial migration are reflected upon: what ecological factors can shape the evolution of migratory dimorphism? How is partial migration maintained over evolutionary timescales? What proximate mechanisms determine whether an individual is migratory or remains resident? Following this, the consequences of partial migration are considered, in an ecological and evolutionary context, and also in an applied sense. Here it is argued that understanding the concept of partial migration is crucial for fisheries and ecosystem managers, and can provide information for conservation strategies. The review concludes with a reflection on the future opportunities in this field, and the avenues of research that are likely to be fruitful to shed light on the enduring puzzle of partial migration in fishes. © 2012 The Authors.

   abstract = {Understanding animal movement decisions that involve migration is critical for evaluating population connectivity, and thus persistence. Recent work on sharks has shown that often only a portion of the adult population will undertake migrations, while the rest may be resident in an area for long periods. Defining the extent to which adult sharks use specific habitats and their migratory behaviour is essential for assessing their risk of exposure to threats such as fishing and habitat degradation. The present study used acoustic telemetry to examine residency patterns and migratory behaviour of adult bull sharks (Carcharhinus leucas) along the East coast of Australia. Fifty-six VR2W acoustic receivers were used to monitor the movements of 33 bull sharks in the central Great Barrier Reef (GBR). Both males and females were detected year-round, but their abundance and residency peaked between September and December across years (2012-2014). High individual variability in reef use patterns was apparent, with some individuals leaving the array for long periods, whereas others (36%) exhibited medium (0.200.40) or high residency (> 0.50). A large portion of the population (51%) undertook migrations of up to 1,400 km to other coral reefs and/ or inshore coastal habitats in Queensland and New South Wales. Most of these individuals (76%) were mature females, and the timing of migrations coincided with the austral summer (Dec-Feb). All migrating individuals (except one) returned to the central GBR, highlighting its importance as a potential foraging ground. Our findings suggest that adult bull sharks appear to be highly dependent on coral reef resources and provide evidence of partial migration, where only a portion of the female population undertook seasonal migrations potentially to give birth. Given that estuarine habitats face constant anthropogenic pressures, understanding partial migration and habitat connectivity of large coastal predators should be a priority for their management.},

Over a lifetime, allocation strategies should result in distinct trajectories for growth, survival, and reproduction, but such longitudinal individual data are difficult to reconstruct for wild animals and especially marine fish. We were able to reconstruct two of these trajectories in wild-caught Northeast Arctic cod (Gadus morhua) females: size-at-age was back-calculated from otolith growth increments, and recent spawning history was reconstructed from postovulatory follicles and present oocyte development. Our findings indicate distinct trade-offs between length growth and reproduction. Fish that sexually matured early had attained a larger size at age 3 than immatures, but onset of reproduction caused slower growth compared with immatures. We found that 6- and 7-year-old females skipping spawning grew significantly more in the year of missed spawning than females spawning for the second consecutive year. The latter tentatively supports the hypothesis that skipped spawning may occur as an adaptive life-history strategy, given the potential future fecundity gain with increased size. © 2014 Published by NRC Research Press.},

   abstract = {Partial migration, or variation in migratory propensity within populations, has been reported across a range of taxa, including fish. Otolith microchemistry has revealed a high degree of life history plasticity in many amphidromous species, with diadromous and non-diadromous recruitment occurring. We examined this plasticity and its effect on population structure, dispersal and recruitment in Galaxias brevipinnis, an amphidromous fish widespread around New Zealand. We used otolith microchemistry analyses to examine recruitment sources and fish surveys to assess abundance and size structure in two large river systems, each containing naturally formed lakes and no obvious physical barriers to migration. Otolith analyses revealed discrete recruitment sources for stream-resident populations, with marine recruitment supporting populations downstream from lakes and exclusively lake-derived recruitment for populations upstream of lakes. Although diadromous G. brevipinnis were abundant within 10 km of the sea, the abundance and relative proportion of younger fish declined as distance upstream increased, until a lake was reached, at which point abundance and the proportion of small individuals increased. The results provide a strong indication that supply is limiting recruitment for G. brevipinnis as distance from pelagic larval habitat increases, and that discrete recruitment sources and population structuring exist even within drainages.},

   abstract = {Diversity in steelhead Oncorhynchus mykiss (anadromous Rainbow Trout) is often characterized by varying time spent in freshwater and saltwater environments. However, ontogenetic shifts are not often highlighted as an important diversity characteristic in salmonids. Larger water bodies can play a key role in population stability by buffering limited resources in smaller tributary systems. Based on freshwater and saltwater ages of adult steelhead in Fish Creek, Idaho, there were 12 different life history trajectories observed. Juvenile abundance varied from 12,083 (SE = 1,225.7) to 62,463 (SE = 1,753.8), with ages ranging from young of the year (age 0) to 4 years. Adult abundance fluctuated from 17 (SE < 0.1) to 499 (SE = 67.1), and total age of adults varied from 3 to 7 years. Diversity was most evident in juvenile movement and rearing strategies. We observed four types of movement and rearing pathways in which juveniles either directly migrated to the ocean from Fish Creek or resided for up to three winters in main-stem river habitat in the Clearwater River basin prior to ocean migration. Most juveniles emigrated in the fall at age 2, and most ocean-emigrating smolts were age 3. Subsequently, most juveniles resided for at least one additional winter period before ocean migration. Juvenile diversity was also reflected in adult ages; the mean proportion that spent 3 years in freshwater was 0.55 (SE = 0.03), and the mean proportion that spent 2 years in freshwater was 0.41 (SE = 0.03). Adult sex ratio was female biased (mean ± SE = 0.66 ± 0.02), with a higher proportion of females (0.89 ± 0.03) than males (0.65 ± 0.05) residing in the ocean for at least 2 years. Density-dependent mechanisms were evident in juvenile rearing habitat in Fish Creek for cohorts of high female abundance. Population productivity potentials can be met when tributary and main-stem rearing habitat can be utilized, and this will be essential in attaining recovery goals.},

   abstract = {Facing the loss of biodiversity caused by landscape fragmentation, implementation of ecological networks to connect habitats is an important biodiversity conservation issue. It is necessary to develop easily reproducible methods to identify and prioritize actions to maintain or restore ecological corridors. To date, several competing methods are used with recurrent debate on which is best and if expert-based approaches can replace data-driven models. We compared three methods: knowledge-driven (expert based), data-driven (based on species distribution model), and a mixed approach. We quantified their differences in habitat and corridor mapping, and prioritizations of landscape elements in terms of importance for connectivity. Key parameters generating these differences were identified. To put this into practice, the case study of the wildcat (Felis silvestris Schreber, 1777) was chosen. The results highlighted differences and similarities between approaches used. The data-driven approach was more successful in identifying the suitable habitat with regard to wildcat ecology, while the knowledge-driven approach was better able to account for obstacles to wildcat movements in the landscape matrix. However, these two methods converged for the identification of patterns of habitat patches and corridors that are important for global landscape connectivity. For both methods, we identified adjustments that can improve the outcome. The mixed approach largely differed in that it required more inputs to be performed. In the end, conservation actions were identified and could guide nature conservation practitioners in their efforts to restore landscape connectivity.},

   abstract = {The nature of conservation challenges can foster a reactive, rather than proactive approach to decision making. Failure to anticipate problems before they escalate results in the need for more costly and time-consuming solutions. Proactive conservation requires forward-looking approaches to decision making that consider possible futures without being overly constrained by the past. Strategic foresight provides a structured process for considering the most desirable future and for mapping the most efficient and effective approaches to promoting that future with tools that facilitate creative thinking. The process involves 6 steps: setting the scope, collecting inputs, analyzing signals, interpreting the information, determining how to act, and implementing the outcomes. Strategic foresight is ideal for seeking, recognizing, and realizing conservation opportunities because it explicitly encourages a broad-minded, forward-looking perspective on an issue. Despite its potential value, the foresight process is rarely used to address conservation issues, and previous attempts have generally failed to influence policy. We present the strategic foresight process as it can be used for proactive conservation planning, describing some of the key tools in the foresight tool kit and how they can be used to identify and exploit different types of conservation opportunities. Scanning is an important tool for collecting and organizing diverse streams of information and can be used to recognize new opportunities and those that could be created. Scenario planning explores how current trends, drivers of change, and key uncertainties might influence the future and can be used to identify barriers to opportunities. Backcasting is used to map out a path to a goal and can determine how to remove barriers to opportunities. We highlight how the foresight process was used to identify conservation opportunities during the development of a strategic plan to address climate change in New York State. The plan identified solutions that should be effective across a range of possible futures. Illustrating the application of strategic foresight to identify conservation opportunities should provide the impetus for decision makers to explore strategic foresight as a way to support more proactive conservation policy, planning, and management.},

Participation rates declined with population density and gross domestic product, indicating a negative effect of urbanisation and post-modernisation on fishing interest. Participation rates also declined with increasing median age, average household size and unemployment rate, suggesting resource limitation to constrain participation in fishing. By contrast, two indicators of the cultural importance of fish (fish landings and per capita fish consumption) and an indicator of perceived need for leisure (weekly working hours) were positively correlated with fishing participation. Based on these findings, which explained 60% of the variance in fishing participation across the industrialised world, reduced fishing interest is to be expected with post-industrialisation. Dedicated management and marketing intervention is needed to reverse the track of diminishing fishing interest in industrialised countries.},

   abstract = {Recreational fisheries (RF) are complex social-ecological systems that play an important role in aquatic environments while generating significant social and economic benefits around the world. The nature of RF is diverse and rapidly evolving, including the participants, their priorities and behaviors, and the related ecological impacts and social and economic benefits. RF can lead to negative ecological impacts, particularly through overexploitation of fish populations and spread of non-native species and genotypes through stocking. Hence, careful management and monitoring of RF is essential to sustain these ecologically and socioeconomically important resources. This special issue on recreational fisheries contains diverse research, syntheses, and perspectives that highlight the advances being made in RF research, monitoring, management, and practice, which we summarize here. Co-management actions are rising, often involving diverse interest groups including government and non-government organizations; applying collaborative management practices can help balance social and economic benefits with conservation targets. Technological and methodological advances are improving the ability to monitor biological, social, and economic dynamics of RF, which underpin the ability to maximize RF benefits through management actions. To ensure RF sustainability, much research focuses on the ecological aspects of RF, as well as the development of management and angling practices that reduce negative impacts on fish populations. For example, angler behavior can be influenced to conform to conservation-minded angling practices through regulations, but is often best accomplished through growing bottom-up social change movements. Anglers can also play an important role in fisheries monitoring and conservation, including providing data on fish abundance and assemblages (i.e., citizen science). The increasing impacts that growing human populations are having on the global environment are threatening many of the natural resources and ecosystem services they provide, including valuable RF. However, with careful development of research initiatives, monitoring and management, sustainable RF can generate positive outcomes for both society and natural ecosystems and help solve allocation conflicts with commercial fisheries and conservation.},

Climate change is anticipated to affect recreational fishing in many ways, creating opportunities and challenges. Rising temperatures or changes in storms and waves are expected to impact the availability of fish to recreational fishers, through changes in recruitment, growth and survival. Shifts in distribution are also expected, affecting the location that target species can be caught. Climate change also threatens the safety of fishing. Opportunities may be reduced owing to rougher conditions, and costs may be incurred if gear is lost or damaged in bad weather. However, not all effects are expected to be negative. Where weather conditions change favourably, participation rates could increase, and desirable species may become available in new areas. Drawing on examples from the UK and Australia, we synthesize existing knowledge to develop a conceptual model of climate-driven factors that could impact marine recreational fisheries, in terms of operations, participation and motivation. We uncover the complex pathways of drivers that underpin the recreational sector. Climate changes may have global implications on the behaviour of recreational fishers and on catches and local economies.},

Recreational fishing is the dominant freshwater fisheries sector in much of the highly developed world and plays a growing role in the marine realm, but in developing countries recreational fisheries occur within a different set of contextual conditions. Little is currently known about attributes of the recreational fishing sector in many developing countries. A survey of fisheries experts designed to identify knowledge gaps surrounding recreational fishery development was conducted to gather information on fishery attributes in developing countries. These surveys were supplemented with a review of relevant literature. Results show that recreational fishing is socially important and is expected to grow in most countries surveyed. Recreational fisheries were described as mainly consumption oriented in these regions. Most often, nonresident tourists used marine waters and resident recreational fishers used fresh waters. There was strong agreement among respondents on the need to address data deficiencies. The knowledge gaps and management needs identified can support international bodies and recreational fishing organizations (such as the regional fisheries bodies of the Food and Agricultural Organization of the United Nations, and local and international fishing associations) to support sustainable development and management of the global recreational fisheries sector.},

   abstract = {—Few paleontological studies of species distribution in time and space have adequately considered the effects of sample size. Most species occur very infrequently, and therefore sample size effects may be large relative to the faunal patterns reported. Examination of 10 carefully compiled large data sets (each more than 1,000 occurrences) reveals that the species-occurrence frequency distribution of each fits the log series distribution well and therefore sample size effects can be predicted. Results show that, if the materials used in assembling a large data set are resampled, as many as 25% of the species will not be found a second time even if both samples are of the same size. If the two samples are of unequal size, then the larger sample may have as many as 70% unique species and the smaller sample no unique species. The implications of these values are important to studies of species richness, origination, and extinction patterns, and biogeographic phenomena such as endemism or province boundaries. I provide graphs showing the predicted sample size effects for a range of data set size, species richness, and relative data size. For data sets that do not fit the log series distribution well, I provide example calculations and equations which are usable without a large computer. If these graphs or equations are not used, then I suggest that species which occur infrequendy be eliminated from consideration. Studies in which sample size effects are not considered should include sample size information in sufficient detail that other workers might make their own evaluation of observed faunal patterns. © 1987, Paleontological Society.

Results agree with work by others and show a shift from a community dominated by shrimp and small forage fishes to one dominated by large piscivorous gadid and flatfish species. The shift occurred rather abruptly in most areas between 1980 and 1982, but the pattern of change differed significantly among areas. Correlations between trends in the two groups of species were weak but were consistent with the hypothesis that the decline in shrimp and forage fishes followed, rather than preceded, the increase in large piscivorous fishes.

Southern kingfish (Menticirrhus americanus), commonly known as whiting, are found from southern New England to Florida. During the fall through winter, western North Atlantic right whales (Eubalaena glacialis) are primarily found in the coastal nearshore waters off South Carolina, Georgia, and Florida, overlapping the whiting's range and habitat. In January 2006, a right whale calf was discovered dead, as a result of gillnet entanglement, in close proximity to the Florida commercial whiting fishing grounds; thus, to assist the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) with developing appropriated right whale conservation management measures, this study evaluated the newly established commercial Florida whiting fishery. Findings revealed that the whiting fishery was established in 2004 and the fishery was prosecuted during the time and area where right whales were found. Moreover, the study found that whiting landings, market value, catch-per-unit-effort (CPUE), dealers, and fishing effort significantly increased during 2000 through 2005. As a result of the right whale calf mortality and threat of gillnet gear to whales, the NMFS prohibited the use of gillnet gear in the US southeastern waters, which inevitably closed the newly established whiting fishery. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

   abstract = {There is a variety of methods used for monitoring environmental variables for the detection of 'unacceptable' levels, such as for compliance conditions. In this paper, we consider the utility of a statistical technique used for many years in industrial process control-cumulative sum or CUSUM-in monitoring water-quality trends within large storages such as reservoirs. By using simulations and realistic values for total phosphorus concentrations, we show the sensitivity of CUSUM schemes to six kinds of trends in quality through time. The six trends are as follows: (a) on target; (b) off target; (c) midpoint (halfway between s and b); (d) ramping change (increasing from a to b over 5 years); (e) weakly autocorrelated series; and (f) strongly autocorrelated series. We study the performance of the CUSUM method in relation to 'average run lengths' (ARLs) before a warning is triggered and the probabilities of spurious warnings (type-1 statistical errors) or failing to detect changes in water quality that are deemed to be unsatisfactory. We conclude that in reasonably buffered systems, such as large storages, the CUSUM technique may be a potentially important way of monitoring water quality that also permits rapid response to serious increases in nutrient concentrations.},

Here, two useful applications of Cusums to environmental time series are presented: Cusums in the time domain and plotting Cusum-transformed variables against non-transformed variables to extract meaning in the context of driver-response relationships. These statistical analyses are simple to conduct and provide valuable information about trends, patterns and thresholds of time-series over time and in relation to potential driver variables. In addition, this work investigates the robustness of the Cusum transform to various characteristics of environmental time series that challenge conventional statistical methods. In summary, this work presents: • Cusum methods to derive meaning from complex environmental time series. • Effects of common time series issues on the Cusums method. • Application to real-world datasets.},

This article reviews some of the family impacts of the net ban, based on data collected from a group of commercial fishing families who participated in a study of family stress and coping before the net ban and agreed to be reinterviewed after this significant event. The results focus on the stress and coping processes families used to adjust to the net ban and the gender differences in the stress process and stress outcomes. Findings indicate that both husbands and wives experience mental health impacts of changes in the industry and that these outcomes manifest in different ways by gender. The article concludes with a discussion of the implications for policies, programs, and services offered to those affected by changes in natural resource regulations.},

   abstract = {Linear regression and cumulative sum analysis (CUSUM) change point analyses were used to determine whether there had been a significant change in the first flowering date between 1983 and 2006 for 65 species. Both methods agreed that the first flowering date of 47 species did not change and that eight species had a significant change (P<0.05) in their flowering. Three species shifted to later flowering and five species to earlier. Over the observation period, each method found that the average shift to later flowering was greater (37.4days or approx. 1.56days per year for CUSUM change point analysis and 51.4days or 2.14days per year for linear regression) than that to earlier flowering (28.4days or approx. 1.20days per year for change point analysis and 46.5days or 1.97days per year for linear regression). For the remaining 10 species the results of linear regression and change point methods differed. Each method found five species (three earlier flowering and two later) to have a significantly changed first flowering date over their observation period, where the other method did not. Some of these differences can be attributed to the fact that the CUSUM method can detect multiple change points whereas linear regression can not. Significant change points in first flowering date were identified for 13 species between the years 1987 to 1998. The most frequent year identified as a change point year was 1995. The two methods, although not interchangeable, had strong agreement (84.6%) in detecting shifts. This gives greater confidence that a change in flowering has occurred for eight species and equally importantly, that no change in first flowering date has occurred for 47 species. © 2012 The Authors.

   abstract = {This study examines the use and interpretation of landed catch as an indicator within fisheries management. A monitoring system has been designed to detect trends in time-series of commercial landings. This system was based upon cumulative sum (CUSUM) control charts and tested using simulated data from delay-difference models. Models were parameterised to represent a prawn fishery, a finfish fishery and an elasmobranch fishery. The performance of the scheme was measured by estimating of the probability of true-positive (sensitivity) and true-negative (specificity) outcomes from the signalling scheme. A true-positive outcome occurred when the exploitable biomass had fallen below a reference point and this situation was signalled as out-of-control. On the basis of simulations, the scheme correctly signalled the state of several fisheries with a probability of 60-80%. Sensitivity analyses of the important assumptions within the analysis are presented and examples of how the scheme would be applied to three species with varying life histories are included. Proximate causes of changes in landed catch will always require additional analysis. This scheme should only be used within the systematic prioritisation of stocks that require additional review and assessment. Precautionary management should not be subsumed into the signal detection algorithm but rather be integrated into the review and assessment process.

   abstract = {We describe a graphical approach for detecting changes in the distribution of the variable over a number of monitoring sites between two or more sample times, with associated randomization tests. This method was derived from the cumulative sum (CUSUM) method that was developed initially for industrial process control, but our use differs in some fundamental ways. In particular, the standard CUSUM procedure is used to detect changes with time in the mean of a variable at one location, whereas our concern is with detecting changes with time in the distribution of a variable measured at a number of different locations. We compare our randomization test for any changes in distribution with the Mann-Kendall test and analysis of covariance in terms of the power for detecting a systematic time trend affecting all sites, with and without serial correlation in time. We also compare these different tests in the situation where trend occurs, but it is not the same at all sites, again with and without serial correlation in time. All tests were adversely affected by high serial correlation, so we repeated the comparisons with the CUSUM and analysis of covariance tests modified to take this into account. We conclude that although our randomization test sometimes has less power than the Mann-Kendall test and analysis of covariance for detecting trends, it does have reasonable power and also has the ability to detect other types of change with time. The modified randomization test is very robust to serial correlation. Copyright (C) 2000 John Wiley and Sons, Ltd.},

The aim of this prospective study was to critically assess the effects, complications, and outcome after LAGB in the long-term, based on a 12-year experience. Between June 1998 and June 2009, all patients with implantation of a LAGB have been enrolled in a prospective clinical trial. Results were recorded and classified, with special regard to long-term complications, re-operation rate, and graft survival. LAGB was performed in 167 patients (120 female, 47 male) with a mean age of 40.1 +/- 5.2 years. Operative mortality was 0%, overall 1.2% (not band-related). Overall patient follow-up was 94.0%. Mean excess weight loss (EWL) after 1, 2, 5, 8, and 10 years was 31.1 +/- 7.5% (p 30 days) occurred in 40.1% (67/167), of whom seven were minor and 60 were major complications (three band infections, two band migrations, 11 band leakages, two slippings/pouch dilatations, two band intolerances, and 40 esophageal dilatations). The overall re-operation rate was 20.4% (34/167). The graft survival of the implanted band after 2, 5, 8, 10, and 12 years was 98.8%, 94.0%, 86.8%, 85.0%, and 85.0%, respectively. The failure rate of the procedure after 2, 5, 8, and 10 years was 25.7%, 24.3%, 25.7%, and 31.6%, respectively. In the present long-term high-participation follow-up study, LAGB is a safe and effective surgical treatment for morbid obesity. However, the high complication, re-operation, and long-term failure rates lead to the conclusion that LAGB should be performed in selected cases only, until reliable criteria for patients at low risk for long-term complications are developed.},

   abstract = {The onset of the Anthropocene necessitates new forms of environmental planning and management as communities adapt to new ecological realities. Despite the global reach of the Anthropocene, localized adaptation strategies are critical for a successful transition into this new epoch. Within local contexts, inclusive, democratic political processes facilitate complex and effective ecological solutions to social problems resulting from environmental change. Genuine incorporation of local knowledge into the decision-making process is critical to fostering this ecological democracy and building effective adaptation strategies. Coastal systems are important nexus points to investigate the relationship between environmental problems and social processes. Fisheries are a critical piece of coastal systems that sustain local communities and the larger economy. I provide a case study of local adaptation to ecological changes as the State of Louisiana attempts to protect vulnerable communities, infrastructure, and fisheries through coastal planning and management. Louisiana’s fisheries are a critical asset that stand to be significantly impacted by continuing coastal erosion. Like the Anthropocene itself, Louisiana’s coastal erosion crisis is largely the result of human intervention in the biosphere for social and economic purposes. The state’s adaptive response is an ambitious master plan that seeks to rebuild the coast and protect its communities and economic interests. Although the plan is ambitious and generally lauded, I argue that the top-down approach the State of Louisiana uses in setting coastal priorities undercuts the plan’s efficacy by struggling to incorporate local knowledge and establish a trusting relationship with coastal stakeholders. Without a genuinely deliberative process that bridges across scales and knowledge systems, the state will ultimately struggle to draw in local knowledge, inhibiting comanagement of local fisheries and potentially undermining the ecological solutions it aims to achieve.},

   abstract = {1. Top-down control can be an important determinant of ecosystem structure and function, but in oceanic ecosystems, where cascading effects of predator depletions, recoveries, and invasions could be significant, such effects had rarely been demonstrated until recently. 2. Here we synthesize the evidence for oceanic top-down control that has emerged over the last decade, focusing on large, high trophic-level predators inhabiting continental shelves, seas, and the open ocean. 3. In these ecosystems, where controlled manipulations are largely infeasible, 'pseudo-experimental' analyses of predator-prey interactions that treat independent predator populations as 'replicates', and temporal or spatial contrasts in predator populations and climate as 'treatments', are increasingly employed to help disentangle predator effects from environmental variation and noise. 4. Substantial reductions in marine mammals, sharks, and piscivorous fishes have led to mesopredator and invertebrate predator increases. Conversely, abundant oceanic predators have suppressed prey abundances. Predation has also inhibited recovery of depleted species, sometimes through predator-prey role reversals. Trophic cascades have been initiated by oceanic predators linking to neritic food webs, but seem inconsistent in the pelagic realm with effects often attenuating at plankton. 5. Top-down control is not uniformly strong in the ocean, and appears contingent on the intensity and nature of perturbations to predator abundances. Predator diversity may dampen cascading effects except where nonselective fisheries deplete entire predator functional groups. In other cases, simultaneous exploitation of predator and prey can inhibit prey responses. Explicit consideration of anthropogenic modifications to oceanic foodwebs should help inform predictions about trophic control. 6. Synthesis and applications. Oceanic top-down control can have important socio-economic, conservation, and management implications as mesopredators and invertebrates assume dominance, and recovery of overexploited predators is impaired. Continued research aimed at integrating across trophic levels is needed to understand and forecast the ecosystem effects of changing oceanic predator abundances, the relative strength of top-down and bottom-up control, and interactions with intensifying anthropogenic stressors such as climate change. © 2009 British Ecological Society.},

Harvest selection may also act on behavioral traits, although this field of research has so far received less attention. We used acoustic tags and a network of receivers to monitor the behavior and fate of individual Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua, N = 60) in their natural habitat on the Norwegian Skagerrak coast. Fish with a strong diel vertical migration, alternating between shallow- and deep-water habitats, had a higher risk of being captured in the fishery (traps, gillnet, hand line) as compared to fish that stayed in deeper water. There was also a significant negative correlation between fish size (30-66 cm) and the magnitude of diel vertical migration.Natural selection on behavior was less clear, but tended to favor fish with a large activity space. On a monthly time scale we found significant repeatabilities for cod behavior, meaning that individual characteristics tended to persist and thereforemay be termed personality traits.We argue that an evolutionary approach to fisheries management should consider fish behavior. This would be of particular relevance for spatial management actions such as marine reserve design. © 2012 The Authors. Ecology and Evolution published by Blackwell Publishing Ltd.},

We identified a range of effects that followed from the removal of these large fish. These effects were revealed within weeks of their removal. Removing large fish (1) altered the behavior of prey fish; (2) reduced rates of herbivory on certain species of reef algae; (3) had both direct positive (reduced mortality of coral recruits) and indirect negative (through reduced grazing pressure on competitive algae) impacts on recruiting corals; and (4) tended to decrease abundances of small mobile benthic invertebrates.

   abstract = {Recently, the importance of the female to population dynamics-especially her non-genetic contribution to offspring fitness or maternal effect-has received much attention in studies of a diverse collection of animal and plant taxa. Of particular interest to fisheries scientists and managers is the role of the demographic structure of the adult component of fish populations in the formation of future year classes. Traditionally, fisheries managers tended to assess whole populations without regard to variation between the individuals within the population. In doing so, they overlooked the variation in spawning production between individual females as a source of variation to recruitment magnitude and fluctuation. Indeed, intensive and/or selective harvesting of larger and older females, those that may produce more-and higher quality-offspring, has been implicated in the collapse of a number of important fish stocks. In a fisheries resource management context, whether capture fisheries or aquaculture, female demographics and inter-female differences warrant serious consideration in developing harvesting and breeding strategies, and in understanding general population dynamics. Here I review the range of female traits and environmental conditions females encounter which may influence the number or quality of their offspring via a maternal effect. © 2008 Elsevier Inc.

   abstract = {There are many barriers to using science to inform conservation policy and practice. Conservation scientists wishing to produce management-relevant science must balance this goal with the imperative of demonstrating novelty and rigor in their science. Decision makers seeking to make evidence-based decisions must balance a desire for knowledge with the need to act despite uncertainty. Generating science that will effectively inform management decisions requires that the production of information (the components of knowledge) be salient (relevant and timely), credible (authoritative, believable, and trusted), and legitimate (developed via a process that considers the values and perspectives of all relevant actors) in the eyes of both researchers and decision makers. We perceive 3 key challenges for those hoping to generate conservation science that achieves all 3 of these information characteristics. First, scientific and management audiences can have contrasting perceptions about the salience of research. Second, the pursuit of scientific credibility can come at the cost of salience and legitimacy in the eyes of decision makers, and, third, different actors can have conflicting views about what constitutes legitimate information. We highlight 4 institutional frameworks that can facilitate science that will inform management: boundary organizations (environmental organizations that span the boundary between science and management), research scientists embedded in resource management agencies, formal links between decision makers and scientists at research-focused institutions, and training programs for conservation professionals. Although these are not the only approaches to generating boundary-spanning science, nor are they mutually exclusive, they provide mechanisms for promoting communication, translation, and mediation across the knowledge-action boundary. We believe that despite the challenges, conservation science should strive to be a boundary science, which both advances scientific understanding and contributes to decision making. © 2013 Society for Conservation Biology.},

A thorough understanding of fish movements is therefore required for informing stock identification, stock assessment, and fishery management. This study investigated the seasonal movements and connectivity of a spring-spawning component of Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua) in the western Gulf of Maine. From 2010 through 2013, spawning cod were sampled within an inshore spawning closure and tagged with conventional tags (n=2368), acoustic transmitters (n=106), and archival data storage tags (n=266). Acoustic receivers were deployed on three inshore spawning sites to test for connectivity among sites. Data from archival tags were used to describe seasonal habitat occupancy and movement patterns via geolocation to statistical areas. Tagging data indicated that cod were primarily residential in the western Gulf of Maine, moving inshore to spawn during the spring (April-July), followed by an offshore migration to their feeding grounds for summer and fall. Cod generally inhabited waters from 45 to 175 m, with the deep offshore basins (>150 m) serving as overwintering habitat. Occupied water temperatures ranged from 4.0 to 13.3 °C, with the coldest temperatures experienced from March through July and the warmest temperatures experienced from September through January. Results provided evidence of spawning site fidelity and connectivity among spawning sites, with some fish visiting multiple spawning sites within or between years. The movements observed during and after the spring-spawning season serve as important mechanisms influencing metapopulation dynamics in the Gulf of Maine region, including both fine- and broad-scale population structure. The improved understanding of cod movement patterns will assist fishery managers in developing management plans, including spawning protection measures, and help to address remaining uncertainties with respect to cod population structure in the Gulf of Maine and other regions.},

Informed by rational choice theory and situational crime prevention framework, this study examines the relationship between local situational factors and illegal fishing in 53 countries. Results suggest that a country's risk of illegal fishing is positively related to the number of commercially significant species found within its territorial waters and its proximity to known ports of convenience. Countries that exercise effective fisheries management and have strong patrol surveillance capacity experience less illegal fishing activity within their territorial waters. The presence of legally fishing vessels does not deter illegal fishing activity. These findings demonstrate the utility of thinking about illegal fishing through the lens of criminology, which is equipped with practical tools to address the problem.

It also focuses on issues coming to the fore, in particular, those related to Sustainable Development Goal 14 and its indicators for which FAO is the “custodian” agency. In addition, Part 2 covers various aspects of fisheries and aquaculture sustainability. The topics discussed range widely, from data and information systems to ocean pollution, product legality, user rights and climate change adaptation. Part 3 now forms the final part of the publication, covering projections and emerging issues such as new technologies and aquaculture biosecurity. It concludes by outlining steps towards a new vision for capture fisheries. The State of World Fisheries and Aquaculture aims to provide objective, reliable and up-to-date information to a wide audience – policymakers, managers, scientists, stakeholders and indeed everyone interested in the fisheries and aquaculture sector.},

   abstract = {Fisheries that target fish spawning aggregations can exhibit hyperstability, in which catch per unit effort (CPUE) remains elevated as stock abundance declines, but empirical support is limited. We compiled several fishery-dependent and fishery-independent data sets to assess stock trends in the barred sand bass (Paralabrax nebulifer) and the kelp bass (Paral-abrax clathratus) in southern California, USA, evaluate the interaction between spawning aggregations and fishing activities, and test for hyperstability. Annual and seasonal trends from fisheries and population data indicate that regional stocks of both species have collapsed in response to overfishing of spawning aggregations and changes in environmental conditions. The aggregating behavior of fish and persistent targeting of spawning aggregations by recreational fisheries combined to produce a hyperstable relationship between CPUE and stock abundance in both species, which created the illusion that population levels were stable and masked fishery collapses. Differences in the rate of decline between the two species may be related to the size, duration, and spatial distribution of their spawning aggregations. Results of this study provide empirical evidence of hyperstability in aggregation-based fisheries and demonstrate that CPUE data be used with caution and given low weight when fishery-independent data are available.},

   abstract = {Overfishing has caused dramatic changes in structures of exploited populations as well as ecosystems. In this article, we focus on fishing effects on age (size) and spatial structures of exploited fishes. Accumulating evidence has shown that large and experienced spawning individuals are able to produce higher quality and quantity of eggs, known as maternal effects, and that individuals of different age classes tend to spawn in different locations and times. These behaviors are associated with a healthy age structure and contribute to bet-hedging capacity that is important in smoothing out short-term environmental variability. Here, we document a widespread phenomenon of age (size)-truncation of exploited populations driven by size-selective fishery removals. Such size-selective fishing may have evolutionary consequence and may be difficult to reverse. In addition, fishing often reduces population spatial heterogeneity that also contributes importantly to bet-hedging. We review studies showing that the effects of age truncation and reduction of spatial heterogeneity have reduced resilience and elevated the fluctuation amplitude of exploited populations facing a changing environment. Recent analyses indicated that fish populations often exhibit nonlinear nature and have potential to shift dramatically in a short time. All the evidence suggests that fishing, by altering age or spatial structures, may make exploited fishes, more prone to catastrophic shifts. Therefore, to achieve sustainable fisheries, management should conserve the age and spatial structure in addition to viable spawning biomass. © Birkhäuser Verlag, Basel/Switzerland 2009.},

   abstract = {Current global fisheries production of ≈160 million tons is rising as a result of increases in aquaculture production. A number of climate-related threats to both capture fisheries and aquaculture are identified, but we have low confidence in predictions of future fisheries production because of uncertainty over future global aquatic net primary production and the transfer of this production through the food chain to human consumption. Recent changes in the distribution and productivity of a number of fish species can be ascribed with high confidence to regional climate variability, such as the El Niño-Southern Oscillation. Future production may increase in some high-latitude regions because of warming and decreased ice cover, but the dynamics in low-latitude regions are governed by different processes, and production may decline as a result of reduced vertical mixing of the water column and, hence, reduced recycling of nutrients. There are strong interactions between the effects of fishing and the effects of climate because fishing reduces the age, size, and geographic diversity of populations and the biodiversity of marine ecosystems, making both more sensitive to additional stresses such as climate change. Inland fisheries are additionally threatened by changes in precipitation and water management. The frequency and intensity of extreme climate events is likely to have a major impact on future fisheries production in both inland and marine systems. Reducing fishing mortality in the majority of fisheries, which are currently fully exploited or overexploited, is the principal feasible means of reducing the impacts of climate change. © 2007 by The National Academy of Sciences of the USA.},

   abstract = {The integration of knowledge from fishers and conventional scientific data is promising as a subsidy for the establishment of proper management procedures for fishing resources. In this context, the potential use of local ecological fisher knowledge from the Marine Extractive Reserve of Corumbau (MERC) in northeastern Brazil was evaluated regarding the shifting baseline of the lane snapper Lutjanus synagris. Semi-structured interviews were carried out with 222 fishers who identified L. synagris as the main fish resource used in MERC. The relationship between the maximum L. synagris weight caught on the best fishing day among fishers of different age categories was not significant (p = 0.306). However, older fishers significantly (p < 0.001) reported a higher time span since their best day catch. In addition, older fishers were significantly more perceptive (p = 0.013) to declining L. synagris abundance over time than younger fishers, who mostly reported that this species abundance is stable or has even increased over time. These results highlight an existing shifting baseline phenomenon for the L. synagris fishery in the region. Only 22.5% of the respondents, mostly younger fishers, expressed a need to establish specific management rules for the species. The proposed strategies for local L. synagris management included establishing a closed period, defining minimum catch sizes and creating new No-Take Zones specifically for this species protection. Trust bonds between fishers and fisheries managers, as well as scientists, require strengthening, and fisher knowledge can serve as a basis for building local targets for species conservation.},

Semi-structured interviews were applied and results were analyzed using WebQDA and R statistical softwares to evaluate the prevalence of responses and multiple correlations. The interviewees were able to morphologically differentiate snook species and describe aspects of food behavior, habitat, migration and reproduction. Part of this knowledge was similar to what is reported in the scientific literature. LEK was evident in commercial fishers and fishing guides when compared to recreational anglers probably due to more extensive experience in the fishing activity. Through the interviewees’ discourse, future scientific research demands were identified, such as understanding the factors that influence the growth of both species, migration between marine and brackish environments and the area of reproduction.

   abstract = {Managing fisheries using length-based harvest regulations is common, but such policies often create trade-offs among conservation (e.g. maintaining natural age-structure or spawning stock biomass) and fishery objectives (e.g. maximizing yield or harvest numbers). By focusing harvest on the larger (older) fish, minimum-length limits are thought to maximize biomass yield, but at the potential cost of severe age and size truncation at high fishing mortality. Harvest-slot-length limits (harvest slots) restrict harvest to intermediate lengths (ages), which may contribute to maintaining high harvest numbers and a more natural age-structure. However, an evaluation of minimum-length limits vs. harvest slots for jointly meeting fisheries and conservation objectives across a range of fish life-history strategies is currently lacking. We present a general age- and size-structured population model calibrated to several recreationally important fish species. Harvest slots and minimum-length limits were both effective at compromising between yield, numbers harvested and catch of trophy fish while conserving reproductive biomass. However, harvest slots consistently produced greater numbers of fish harvested and greater catches of trophy fish while conserving reproductive biomass and a more natural population age-structure. Additionally, harvest slots resulted in less waste in the presence of hooking mortality. Our results held across a range of exploitation rates, life-history strategies and fisheries objectives. Overall, we found harvest slots to represent a valuable option to meet both conservation and recreational fisheries objectives. Given the ubiquitous benefits of harvest slots across all life histories modelled, rethinking the widespread use of minimum-length limits is warranted.},

   abstract = {While the physical dimensions of climate change are now routinely assessed through multimodel intercomparisons, projected impacts on the global ocean ecosystem generally rely on individual models with a specific set of assumptions. To address these single-model limitations, we present standardized ensemble projections from six global marine ecosystem models forced with two Earth system models and four emission scenarios with and without fishing. We derive average biomass trends and associated uncertainties across the marine food web. Without fishing, mean global animal biomass decreased by 5% (±4% SD) under low emissions and 17% (±11% SD) under high emissions by 2100, with an average 5% decline for every 1 °C of warming. Projected biomass declines were primarily driven by increasing temperature and decreasing primary production, and were more pronounced at higher trophic levels, a process known as trophic amplification. Fishing did not substantially alter the effects of climate change. Considerable regional variation featured strong biomass increases at high latitudes and decreases at middle to low latitudes, with good model agreement on the direction of change but variable magnitude. Uncertainties due to variations in marine ecosystem and Earth system models were similar. Ensemble projections performed well compared with empirical data, emphasizing the benefits of multimodel inference to project future outcomes. Our results indicate that global ocean animal biomass consistently declines with climate change, and that these impacts are amplified at higher trophic levels. Next steps for model development include dynamic scenarios of fishing, cumulative human impacts, and the effects of management measures on future ocean biomass trends.},

   abstract = {Fish populations with broad age distributions are expected to have higher reproductive capacity than age-truncated populations because of the disproportionate contributions of older fish. Harvest slot limits, an expected means of ameliorating age truncation, are modeled for Tautog Tautoga onitis in an overfished population subunit that is experiencing overfishing. Tautog, currently managed with a 40-cm minimum size limit (MSL), is a candidate species for slots because it is relatively long-lived and slow-growing, with low discard mortality. We evaluated changes in biomass and abundance at age relative to management with the current MSL regulations using a forward population simulation model for four slots: 35–45 cm (small–wide), 38–42 cm (small–narrow), 40–50 cm (large–wide), and 43–47 cm (large-narrow), inclusive of lower and upper length limits. Angler behavioral responses were evaluated at 0, 10, and 20% noncompliance with the upper slot limit. The biomass and number of fish removed were reduced with harvest slot limit management relative to the MSL, but because the harvest was redirected to smaller fish the reduction in numbers removed was not as large as the reduction in biomass removed. Slot limits broadened the age structure within 10 years by reducing fishing mortality on extant fish. Median spawning stock biomass (SSB) recovered more quickly in three of the slots than with MSL regulation (3–6 years to reach SSB associated with a fishing mortality that yields 30% spawners per recruit as compared to 9 years with MSL management). We concluded that harvest slot limits can broaden age structure and restore biomass in overfished fisheries, but they should be evaluated when managing coastal fisheries as a reduction in biomass removed is required.},

   abstract = {With minimal moral hazard and adverse selection, weather index insurance promises financial resilience to farmers struck by harsh weather conditions through swift compensation at affordable premium. Despite these advantages, the very nature of indexing gives rise to production basis risk as the selected weather indexes do not sufficiently correspond to actual damages. To address this problem, we develop a stochastic yield model, built upon a stochastic soil moisture model driven by marked Poisson rainfall. Our analysis shows that even under similar temperature and rainfall amount yields can differ significantly; this was empirically supported by a 2-year field experiment in which rain-fed maize was grown under very similar total rainfall. Here, the year with more intense, less-frequent rainfall produces a better yield—a rare counter evidence to most climate change projections. Through a stochastic yield model, we demonstrate the crucial roles of rainfall intensity and frequency in determining the yield. Importantly, the model allows us to compute rainfall pattern-related basis risk inherent in cumulative rain index insurance. The model results and a case study herein clearly show that total rainfall is a poor indicator of yield, imposing unnecessary production basis risk on farmers and false-positive payouts on insurers. Incorporating rainfall intensity and frequency in the design of rain index insurance can offer farmers better protection, while maintaining the attractive features of the weather index insurance and thus fulfilling its promise of financial resilience.},

   abstract = {Snapper, Chrysophrys auratus, is a highly important fishery resource of southern Australia. Through the late 2000s, the State of South Australia (SA) produced record commercial catches of this species, making the dominant contribution to the national catch. This was associated with dramatic changes in contributions from SA's regional fisheries. The demographic processes responsible for these unprecedented changes were not understood, reflecting poor understanding of large-scale movement of snapper and its influence on regional population dynamics and stock structure. This study used otolith chemistry to investigate the movement behaviour and stock structure of snapper in the eastern part of southern Australia. Transverse sections of otoliths from four year classes and six geographic regions distributed over 1500 km of coastline were sampled by continuous life-history profiles across the chronological structure using laser ablation inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry. Element:calcium ratios were integrated with annual increment measurements to produce profiles of age-related, annual averages for Ba:Ca, Sr:Ca, Mn:Ca and Mg:Ca. Significant regional differences for each annual zone were used to infer differences in fish origins and inter-regional movement. Variation in Ba:Ca was most informative and indicated that an episodic fishery along the south east coastal region of SA is linked to periods of stock range expansion, involving movement over 600 km, from a major nursery area, Port Phillip Bay (PPB), in the adjacent state of Victoria. Periods of stock range expansion coincided with exceptionally strong year-classes originating from spawning in PPB. Inferences from the element:calcium profiles and other information suggested that the populations in the northern parts of the two gulfs of SA appear to be separate, self-recruiting and independent of inter-regional movement. Each, however, is an important nursery area and source of emigration that replenishes regional populations in adjacent coastal waters. The results support SA's snapper fishery being divided into three stocks, each dependent on a primary nursery area. The source for the intermittent fishery in the south east region of SA is within a separate management jurisdiction (Victoria), necessitating consideration of multi-jurisdictional assessment and management. We hypothesise that density-related processes are responsible for range expansion of this multi-jurisdictional stock, with strong year classes producing more extensive emigration and range expansion into SA waters. The study provides an example of the value of life-history otolith chemistry profiles for resolving stock structure at regional scales with implications for fisheries assessment and management.},

   abstract = {Constructed treatment wetlands intercept nutrients in surface runoff to protect downstream ecosystems. Conventionally, nutrient removal is considered from a chemical kinetics perspective that assumes outlet concentrations tend toward equilibrium. We propose a broader view that includes management intervention as part of the system, and we explore the possibility that complex concentration dynamics emerge endogenously from nonlinear interactions. In particular, through application of a novel nonlinear time series diagnostic framework, we empirically test whether phosphorus removal at two Stormwater Treatment Areas (STAs) in South Florida might be enhanced through improved management of hydraulic and phosphorus loads. We isolated low-dimensional, deterministic signals in STA input/output dynamics (flows and total phosphorus concentrations); mapped causal interactions among covariates; and developed parsimonious data-driven dynamic models to simulate and characterize key interactions. At STA-3/4, inflow dynamics systematically drove outlet concentrations, suggesting that outlet concentration variability might be reduced through enhanced hydraulic load management. We also detected management feedback in the reverse direction—STA-3/4 outlet concentrations driving inflows—and identified a possible inefficiency in this management response. At STA-2, neither flows nor inlet concentrations systematically drove outlet concentrations, suggesting that the wetland effectively removed incoming load signals. However, STA-2 inflows were evidently influenced by inlet concentrations (management feedback). The differing management feedback structures between STAs suggest that STA-3/4 performance might be improved by managing hydraulic loads more strongly in response to inlet concentrations. More broadly, this work demonstrates that management-relevant insights into dynamic cause-and-effect relationships can be gleaned from observed treatment dynamics.},

Although frequently used to reconstruct past environments, the influence of physiology remains unsettled. As such, we investigated the relationships between otolith chemistry, physiological factors and environmental factors in an iconic fishery species, snapper (Chrysophrys auratus). Lifetime otolith profiles were analysed of carbon (δ13C) and oxygen (δ18O) isotopes, and elemental concentrations of lithium (Li: Ca), magnesium (Mg: Ca), manganese (Mn: Ca), strontium (Sr: Ca), and barium (Ba: Ca). Mixed-effects modelling alongside a detailed literature review was used to investigate physiological (age, otolith growth rate, fish size, sex) and environmental influences (sea-surface temperature and chlorophyll-a) on otolith chemistry. Carbon isotopes and magnesium related to physiological factors, suggesting their potential as physiological proxies. Physiology also weakly related to strontium and lithium. By contrast, oxygen isotopes, barium, and manganese (except for natal signatures) were suggested to provide insights into past environments. Our study stresses the importance of consistency in biological characteristics for study designs, and highlights the potential of physiological proxies for distinguishing between populations in uniform water bodies. This study has not only reinforced our confidence in field applications of otolith chemistry, but has furthered our understanding of the influence of physiology.},

   abstract = {Harmful algal blooms (HABs) threaten coastal ecological systems, public health, and local economies, but the complex physical, chemical, and biological processes that culminate in HABs vary by locale and are often poorly understood. Despite broad recognition that cultural eutrophication may exacerbate nearshore bloom events, the association is typically not linear and is often difficult to quantify. Off the Gulf Coast of Florida, Karenia brevis blooms initiate in the open waters of the Gulf of Mexico, and advection of cells supplies nearshore blooms. However, past work has struggled to describe the relationship between terrestrial nutrient runoff and bloom maintenance near the Gulf Coast. This study applied a novel nonlinear time series (NLTS) analytical framework to investigate whether nearshore bloom dynamics observed near Charlotte Harbor, FL were causally and systematically driven by terrestrially sourced inputs of nitrogen, phosphorus, and freshwater between 2012 and 2018. Singular spectrum analysis (SSA) isolated low-dimensional, deterministic signals in K. brevis log10-density dynamics and in the dynamics of nine of 10 candidate drivers. The predominantly seasonal K. brevis signal was strong, explaining 77.6% of the total variance in the observed time series. Causal tests with convergent cross-mapping provided evidence that nitrogen concentrations measured at the discharge point of the Caloosahatchee River systematically influenced K. brevis bloom dynamics. However, further causal testing failed to link these nitrogen dynamics to an upstream basin, possibly due to data limitations. The results support the hypothesis that anthropogenic nitrogen runoff facilitated the growth of K. brevis blooms near Charlotte Harbor and suggest that bloom events would be mitigated by nitrogen source and transport controls within the Caloosahatchee and/or Kissimmee River basins. More broadly, this work demonstrates that management-relevant causal inferences into the drivers of HABs may be drawn from available monitoring records.},

Fish from the 9+ age class were sampled from six different regions, encompassing >2000 km of coastline and different habitat types. The chemistry of transverse sections of otoliths was sampled using laser ablation inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry, providing elemental profiles that were related to age for the first nine years of the fish's lives. The age-related annual averages for both 88Sr and 138Ba differed significantly between regions. They were, however, similar for the first three years, then diverged considerably between the ages of three to five years, and then remained consistently different through to the age of nine years. This suggests that all fish, regardless of where captured, originated from only one or two nursery areas, but dispersed throughout the different regions between the ages of three to five years, before becoming resident to their new regions of occupancy. Thus, this population of snapper represents a single, large, stock where the individuals have a common origin, but through age-related emigration ultimately disperse and supplement the low abundance populations in regional State waters. © CSIRO 2005.},

What is not widely appreciated, however, is how the use of such synthesized data can overestimate predictive skill when forecasting recruitment is part of the assessment process. Using a global database of stock assessments, we show that Standard Fisheries Models (SFMs) can successfully predict synthesized data based on presumed stock-recruitment relationships, however, they are generally less skillful at predicting observational data that are either raw or minimally filtered (denoised without using explicit stock-recruitment models). Additionally, we find that an equation-free approach that does not presume a specific stock-recruitment relationship is better than SFMs at predicting synthesized data, and moreover it can also predict observational recruitment data very well. Thus, while synthesized datasets are cheaper in the short term, they carry costs that can limit their utility in predicting real world recruitment.},

   abstract = {Following Lake Michigan's lake trout (Salvelinus namaycush) population collapse in the mid-1900s, fisheries managers began stocking marked juveniles in 1965 in an effort to restore the population. However, there has been little evidence of naturally produced juveniles recruiting to the adult life stage, but recent collections of unmarked adults in Illinois waters of Lake Michigan suggest otherwise. Here, we provide stable isotopic evidence that confirms recruitment to the adult life stage is occurring in southwestern Lake Michigan. Our results indicate substantial differences in δ18O and δ13C values between hatchery-reared juvenile lake trout and the putative wild adults, effectively eliminating the possibility that unmarked adults were erroneously miss-clipped as hatchery-reared juveniles. We also found significant differences in δ18O signatures between lakes Michigan and Huron and successfully classified over 90% of putative wild adult lake trout as Lake Michigan-origin. Trace element analyses were less effective in distinguishing fish from lakes Huron and Michigan than otolith δ18O. These findings indicate that Lake Michigan's lake trout restoration program is at least partially effective. Further investigation is required to determine what factors may be facilitating natural reproduction and adult recruitment in southwestern Lake Michigan.},

To understand the ecology of the early life stage specimens of Japanese sardine Sardinops melanostictus and Japanese anchovy Engraulis japonicus collected from Toyama Bay, Japan, we used a submicrogram-scale stable isotopic analytical system called MICAL3c to investigate otolith δ13C and δ18O values of larvae and juveniles. The otolith δ13C and δ18O values of the two species showed a decreasing trend with ontogeny. Temperatures estimated from otolith δ18O values suggest that otolith δ18O values may record a decline in ambient salinity rather than seasonal increase in temperature during the transportation from the spawning to the fishing grounds, or an ontogenetic shift in the pH of the endolymph. Sea surface salinity in Toyama Bay was drastically decreased along the southern shore compared with elsewhere in the bay, whereas the sea surface temperature distribution was rather uniform. Considering that the main sardine and anchovy spawning ground is in the western part of Toyama Bay and that a counterclockwise current usually prevails in the bay, the salinity change associated with the transport of larvae from the spawning ground to the sampling site may explain the otolith δ18O change. The δ13C and δ18O values recorded in otoliths of two species are inconsistent with the observed temperatures, but this may be due to unmeasured variability of δ13C (dissolved inorganic carbon, DIC) and δ18O (H2O) in seawater and/or physiological effects on the calcification process.},

   abstract = {The effectiveness of recreational fisheries governance has been mixed, with some countries boasting good governance practices that sustain productive recreational fisheries, while others lack any policies and governance structures specific to recreational fisheries. Here, we identify what constitutes effective governance of recreational fisheries by carrying out: (a) a desktop review of 227 country-specific fisheries legislation, policies and strategies; and (b) a follow-up questionnaire-based survey covering 57 contacts in 29 selected countries. Our results show that while recreational fishing is referred to in the main legislation of 67% of the countries reviewed, only 86 of these 152 countries provide a definition for either “recreational” or “sport” fishing and not always in the main legislation. Recreational fisheries are not considered to be effectively managed in many countries, with less than a quarter of respondents claiming that management in their country is effective. Furthermore, the management efficacy, including compliance with regulations, was considered greater for the industrial and small-scale fishing sectors than for recreational fisheries in most countries. From our findings, it appears that effective recreational fisheries governance requires explicit acknowledgement of recreational fisheries with a clear legal definition in Policy, a well-developed Policy statement, extensive co-management processes, clearly defined biological, economic and social monitoring structures and efficient and transparent cost recovery mechanisms. To ensure adaptation to rapidly changing conditions, policy should recognize all fishery sectors and proactively incorporate adaptive planning and contingency plans to effectively secure the diverse values of resources for all users.},

   abstract = {Science-based natural resource management is necessary for agencies to effectively meet their goals and mandates. However, this scientific basis needs to be advanced and evolved with ecosystems experiencing unprecedented events that challenge conventional management frameworks. Effectively managing marine resources and achieving agency missions requires more than meeting independent mandates and managing individual resources as chronic stressors overwhelm conventional management frameworks. Global science organizations are transitioning to interdisciplinary and holistic research to integrate human well-being as a key outcome. The United States’ principal federal agency tasked with managing coastal and marine ecosystems is the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). NOAA’s vision is “healthy ecosystems, communities and economies that are resilient in the face of change”. NOAA adopted the Integrated Ecosystem Assessment (IEA) approach to conduct the collaborative science necessary for ecosystem-based management. IEAs have been employed for over a decade to develop science, tools, and collaborations that address complex ecosystem challenges and make progress toward NOAA’s vision. This paper demonstrates, through case studies, how scientists, stakeholders, and managers build trust and meaningful relationships from the IEA approach. These case studies further demonstrate how the IEA approach can be adapted to various geographic and management scales to build trust with partners and provide the ecosystem science, including social science, required to build resilient coastal ecosystems, communities, and economies.},

The large number and variety of principles that make up EBM, and the diversity in perspectives among key management players, has impeded the practical application of EBM. Agreement on a list of the essential ingredients of EBM is vital to successful application. A frequency analysis of EBM principles was conducted to identify the Key Principles that currently define EBM, from a list of twenty-six principles extracted from a subset of the EBM theoretical/conceptual literature (covering a range of published sources across disciplines and application types). Fifteen Key Principles were identified (in descending frequency of appearance in the literature): Consider Ecosystem Connections, Appropriate Spatial & Temporal Scales, Adaptive Management, Use of Scientific Knowledge, Integrated Management, Stakeholder Involvement, Account for Dynamic Nature of Ecosystems, Ecological Integrity & Biodiversity, Sustainability, Recognise Coupled Social-Ecological Systems, Decisions reflect Societal Choice, Distinct Boundaries, Interdisciplinarity, Appropriate Monitoring, and Acknowledge Uncertainty. This paper also examines the development of EBM principles over time, leading to predictions on the directions EBM will take in the future. The frequency analysis methodology used here can be replicated to update the Key Principles of EBM in the future. Indeed, further research on potential emerging Key Principles such as 'Consider Cumulative Impacts', 'Apply the Precautionary Approach' and 'Explicitly Acknowledge Trade Offs' will help shape EBM and its successful application in the management of marine activities.},

Previous work found a significant downward trend for Bonefish CPUE from 1980 to 2014, and a structural breakpoint in the year 2000. Our objective was to develop and use an age-structured model to explore the relative role of recruitment and changes to adult mortality to explain the decline. Parameters for Bonefish growth, mortality, fecundity and recruitment were compiled from previous research and literature. The CPUE time series from 1980 to 2014 was used to fit the model. Recruit survivorship was responsible for explaining most of the variation in the CPUE time series, while adult survivorship had a significant downward trend. There was no statistically significant structural breakpoint in the survivorship time series, but there was a shift in the mean values in 1998 for adult survivorship and 2008 for recruit survivorship. The shift in adult survivorship is close to the CPUE breakpoint and thus interpreted as driving that change. The fact that there is also a shift in recruit survivorship is cause for concern and warrants continued monitoring of Bonefish populations and research into spawning and recruitment. There is a need to identify biophysical, climatological and habitat variables that are responsible for recruitment and mortality anomalies, and the time series estimates generated in this study will be useful for the analysis of management and conservation decisions in relation to these variables.},

Twenty-three publications, including twenty-nine case studies, were reviewed with the aim of investigating how local knowledge, community-based conservation, and resilience interrelate in social-ecological systems. We highlight that such relationships have not been systematically addressed in regions where a great number of community conservation initiatives are found; and we identify a set of factors that foster people's adaptive capacity to social-ecological change and a number of social processes that, in contrast, undermine such capacity and the overall resilience of the socialecological system. We suggest that there is a need to further investigate how climate variability and other events affect the joint evolution of conservation outcomes and traditional ecological knowledge, and there is a need to expand the current focus on social factors to explain changes in traditional ecological knowledge and adaptive capacity towards a broader approach that pays attention to ecosystem dynamics and environmental change. © 2013 by the author(s).},

   abstract = {We analyze the strategies and actions that enable transitions toward ecosystem-based management using the recent governance changes of the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park as a case study. The interplay among individual actors, organizations, and institutions at multiple levels is central in such transitions. A flexible organization, the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority, was crucial in initiating the transition to ecosystem-based management. This agency was also instrumental in the subsequent transformation of the governance regime and provided leadership throughout the process. Strategies involved internal reorganization and management innovation, leading to an ability to coordinate the scientific community, to increase public awareness of environmental issues and problems, to involve a broader set of stakeholders, and to maneuver the political system for support at critical times. The transformation process was induced by increased pressure on the Great Barrier Reef (from terrestrial runoff, overharvesting, and global warming) that triggered a new sense of urgency to address these challenges. The focus of governance shifted from protection of selected individual reefs to stewardship of the larger-scale seascape. The study emphasizes the significance of stewardship that can change patterns of interactions among key actors and allow for new forms of management and governance to emerge in response to environmental change. This example illustrates that enabling legislations or other social bounds are essential, but not sufficient for shifting governance toward adaptive comanagement of complex marine ecosystems. © 2008 by The National Academy of Sciences of the USA.},

   abstract = {A growing number of studies suggest a participatory ecosystem approach to support decision-making toward resilience and sustainability in social-ecological systems. Social-ecological resilience (SER) principles and practices are recommended to manage natural crises. However, it is necessary to broaden our understanding of SER on human-induced disturbances driven by economic development projects. In this paper we present the social-ecological system of Araçá Bay (Brazil), a small-scale fishery community that has experienced successive disturbances due to development projects since the 1930s. There was a lack of studies about the impacts of development projects in this bay. As part of a major project that aimed to build an ecosystem-based management plan for Araçá Bay through a participatory planning process, we focused on investigating fishers’ traditional ecological knowledge (TEK) to understand Araçá Bay’s small-scale fisheries social-ecological system. The objectives were to: (1) investigate fishers’ TEK regarding management practices and linked social mechanisms, human-induced disturbances and their consequences for the social-ecological system, ecosystem goods and services, and future threats; and (2) provide information based on TEK to the participatory planning process and analyze its contribution to Araçá Bay’s ecosystem-based management plan. Combined methods were used during 3 years of intense research-action (2014–2017): in-depth ethno-oceanographic interviews with expert fishers; monitoring Araçá Bay participatory meetings; and participant observation. Genuine local practices and social mechanisms from traditional culture were recorded, as well as TEK about 57 target fish species and methods to protect habitats and natural resources. Fishers also reported ecosystem disturbances and recovery processes. TEK was codified through SWOT analysis to assist the participatory planning process. Ecosystem services and threats based on TEK were brought to the participatory process, acknowledged by the participants, and incorporated into the management plan. TEK analysis proved to be an important methodology to provide historical environmental data regarding the impacts of development projects and support planning in disturbed ecosystems. In order to support coastal marine ecosystem-based management strategies toward SER and sustainability, researchers and practitioners should consider traditional territories in planning, recognize local practices and social mechanisms, and consider TEK on ecosystem goods and services and on historical human-induced disturbances.},

   abstract = {In many parts of the world, there is increasing interest among scientists, managers, and communities in merging long-enduring customary practices such as taboos that limit resource use with contemporary resource management initiatives. Here, we synthesize the literature on the customary management of coral reefs emerging from diverse disciplines including anthropology, common property economics, and ecology. First, we review various customary management strategies and draw parallels with Western fisheries management. Secondly, we examine customary resource management and conservation. We argue that, while resource conservation often appears to be an unintended by-product of other social processes, customary management can, in fact, conserve marine resources. In the third section, we examine the resilience of customary management institutions to socioeconomic transformations. We suggest that in conditions of high population and commercialization of marine resources, property rights may become strengthened but arrangements that rely on self-restraint become weakened. Finally, we examine the commensurability of customary management and conservation. We emphasize that practical and conceptual differences exist between customary management and contemporary conservation which have often led to failed attempts to hybridize these systems. However, when these differences are understood and acknowledged there exists a potential to develop adaptive management systems that are: (1) highly flexible; (2) able to conserve resources, and; (3) able to meet community goals. In each section, we provide research priorities. We conclude by developing six key features of successful hybrid management systems. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

To clarify discussion and provide a framework for implementation, I trace the historical development of ecosystem management, provide a working definition, and summarize dominant themes taken from an extensive literature review. The general goal of maintaining ecological integrity is discussed along with five specific goals: maintaining viable populations, ecosystem representation, maintaining ecological process (i.e., natural disturbance regimes), protecting evolutionary potential of species and ecosystems, and accommodating human use in light of the above. Short-term policy implications of ecosystem management for several groups of key actors (scientists, policy makers, managers, citizens) are discussed. Long-term (>100 years) policy implications are also reviewed including reframing environmental values, fostering cooperation, and evaluating success. Ecosystem management is not just about science nor is it simply an extension of traditional resource management; it offers a fundamental reframing of how humans may work with nature.},

In this method, a diver searches a dive site and records all observed fish species and their abundance in log10 categories. Results from 130 h of observation were analyzed from three regional surveys conducted in the Florida Keys at a total of 27 reefs by four observers during the summer of 1994. The Upper Keys had the most species (166) followed by the Lower Keys (151) and the Dry Tortugas (142). More uncommon species were found in the Dry Tortugas. Experienced volunteer divers were able to provide useful species listings, frequency of occurrence and abundance data. We recommend multiple surveys from one site and day and night surveys for providing most complete species listings. Cluster analysis of reefs using Jaccard similarity indicies showed that reefs within a region clustered together and that reefs in close geographical proximity generally had the highest similarity. Data showed spatial distributions and species abundance patterns consistent with previous studies.},

   abstract = {The potential impacts of sea level rise (SLR) on 95% of the land areas of the Florida Keys were estimated through analysis of a digital elevation model (DEM) derived from airborne light detection and ranging (LiDAR) measurements in a geographic information system. The topographic detail of the LiDAR DEM allowed projections of land, population, and property inundation in 0.15 m increments across a broad range of SLR scenarios for the next century. The results showed that a 0.6 m SLR by 2100 would inundate about 70% of the total land surface, but smaller percentages of the population (17%) and real property (12%). A 1.5 m rise in sea level during the same period would inundate 91% of the land surface, 71% of the population and 68% of property in the study area. Comparison of inundation dynamics indicates that the Lower Florida Keys are more susceptible to SLR than the Upper Florida Keys. The inundation dynamics exhibit non-linear behavior and demonstrate tipping points in inundation processes beyond which the inundation of land, population, and property speeds up. Acceleration of SLR will amplify the non-linear inundation, causing tipping points to be reached sooner. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.},

Along the south Texas and Florida coasts, isotopic analyses showed that seagrass meadows and possibly other shallow estuarine habitats are important feeding grounds for shrimp that are later caught in offshore fisheries. During feeding and growth offshore, eventual convergence about offshore isotopic values should result for the migratory species studied. However, striking differences in convergence patterns were evident for the five species, ranging from close convergence at small, subadult sizes (P. aztecus and P. duorarum) to nonconvergence among adults (L. xanthurus). These differences point to contrasts in the basic life history patterns of migration (especially the juvenile vs. adult size at which offshore migration occurs), and, for one species, showed that isotopic methods can trace yearly variations in these patterns.-from Author},

Otoliths were collected from Grey Mackerel at ten locations representing much of their distributional and fisheries range across northern Australia from 2005 to 2007. Across this broad range (~ 6500 km), fish from four broad locations-Western Australia (S1), NT and Gulf of Carpentaria (S2, S3, S4, S5, S6, S7), Queensland east coast mid and north sites (S8, S9) and Queensland east coast south site (S10)-had stable isotope values that were significantly different indicating stock separation. Otolith stable isotopes differed more between locations than among years within a location, indicating temporal stability across years. The spatial separation of these populations indicates a complex stock structure across northern Australia. Stocks of S. semifasciatus appear to be associated with large coastal embayments. These results indicate that optimal fisheries management may require a review of the current spatial arrangements, particularly in relation to the evidence of shared stocks in the Gulf of Carpentaria. Furthermore, as the population of S. semifasciatus in Western Australia exhibited high spatial separation from those at all the other locations examined, further research activities should focus on investigating additional locations within Western Australia for an enhanced determination of stock delineation. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.},

Its unique ecological characteristics and location near densely populated urban areas make Florida Bay a popular tourist destination for recreational fishing. A survey of recreational anglers and guides was conducted to estimate the economic significance of recreational fishing in the Bay. Results indicate that recreational fishing on Florida Bay contributed $439 million in economic activity to the local economy in the year the study was conducted. Further, anglers from outside the region made up a disproportionate share of the economic contribution. Anglers were also queried through the survey about their opinions of the current status of the Bay. Most respondents indicated that they perceived that the quality of fish populations and habitat was declining, and that they fished the Bay less frequently than in the past. The importance of the results to restoration efforts targeting the Bay and the greater Everglades ecosystem is discussed.},

Differences in elemental composition of juveniles were found among estuaries or groups of estuaries suggesting that the nursery or recruitment estuary of adult fish could be determined by analysing the juvenile region of adult otoliths. Adult fish from the commercial fishery in the vicinity of Sydney, New South Wales, Australia were then collected, their ages estimated and fish with birth years during 1998-99 selected for microchemical analysis to determine their recruitment estuary. Maximum likelihood analyses were used to determine the proportion of juvenile fish and adult fish from different regions (Wallis Lake, Sydney estuaries, Eden, and other estuaries). For juvenile fish, the actual composition ranged from 7 to 53% depending on the estuary or group of estuaries and the estimate of proportion of juveniles from the different estuaries ranged from 7.24 to 48.21% suggesting an error rate of <1 to 4.79%. Most (89%) adult fish caught as part of the snapper fishery in the Sydney region originated from local estuaries, although about 9% of fish had Eden as their recruitment estuary and 2% had come from the remaining estuaries excluding Wallis Lake, which contributed no fish. These results suggest that adults on reefs outside estuaries in the Sydney region have come from the estuaries closest to them with little transfer from other estuaries. For other regions, 2 scenarios are possible, namely, adults originated from estuaries close by with little transfer from other estuaries, or alternatively estuaries in the vicinity of Sydney supply the majority of adult fish along the coast. The latter situation is considered unlikely. Results show a link between juvenile and adult populations and suggest that populations of snapper may be self-sustaining or relatively closed.},

   abstract = {The elemental fingerprints or composition of otoliths of fish may provide a natural tag of the 'nursery' habitat of juvenile fish. The natural tag could then be used to determine the 'nursery' habitat of adult fish found on coastal reefs. We collected juvenile Pelates sexlineatus from 2 to 5 sites within each of 7 estuaries to determine whether elemental composition of otoliths differed among estuaries and among sites within estuaries. In addition, fish were collected in 2 successive years to determine whether temporal differences may be found in elemental fingerprints that could then confound subsequent assignment of adults to 'nursery' estuaries. Significant differences in elemental fingerprints (Sr, Ba and Mn) were found within and among estuaries, but there was often an interaction with time suggesting that there were differences among estuaries/sites but the difference varied between times. Quadratic discriminant functions (QDFs) generated to discriminate among estuaries suggested that the QDFs calculated from a single year class were more successful at assigning fish to the correct estuary than either (1) QDFs based on both years combined or (2) using the QDFs generated from the first year class to classify the second year class. Small-scale variability among sites within an estuary suggested that for an estuarine fishery we may be able to classify fish to their site of origin; this warrants further investigation. Adult fish from a coastal fishery can now be assigned to their 'nursery' estuary by analysing the juvenile region of their otoliths, provided that discriminant functions are generated from the appropriate year class of recruits.},

Taking a longitudinal approach of following cohorts over time, we evaluated evidence for mangrove-derived replenishment of 10 coral reef fishes by drawing on data from 2 concurrent fish monitoring efforts conducted in Biscayne National Park, Florida, USA, over the period 1999 to 2007. Annual indices of abundance were calculated for fish estimated to be age-0 to 4+ in both habitats, and correlation analyses, with appropriate temporal lags, were performed. Statistically significant (p < 0.05; r2 = 0.30 to 0.71) correlations between juvenile abundances in mangrove habitats and adult abundances on the reef tract 1 to 2 yr later emerged for 4 species: Abudefduf saxatilis, Lutjanus apodus, L. griseus, and Sphyraena barracuda. This is one of the few longitudinal studies that uses juvenile abundance indices to test mangrove-reef ontogenetic connectivity. Our results have potential utility for nursery habitat assessment, marine reserve design, and for forecasting species-specific year-class strength on the reef, where most fishing is directed.

The Mondego estuary, located near the latitudinal limit of P. flesus, contributed moderate numbers to coastal populations. The Tejo estuary was the most important estuary for D. labrax in both years sampled (55 and 50%, respectively), whilst the Ria de Aveiro hardly contributed to sea bass coastal populations (<2%). Ultimately, knowledge of which estuaries replenish coastal adult populations, and both local and distant fisheries, is essential for effective management and conservation of these species and their estuarine juvenile habitats. © 2013 The authors.},

   abstract = {The elemental fingerprints or composition of otoliths of fish may provide a natural tag of the 'nursery' habitat of juvenile fish. The natural tag could then be used to determine the 'nursery' habitat of adult fish found on coastal reefs. We collected juvenile Pelates sexlineatus from 2 to 5 sites within each of 7 estuaries to determine whether elemental composition of otoliths differed among estuaries and among sites within estuaries. In addition, fish were collected in 2 successive years to determine whether temporal differences may be found in elemental fingerprints that could then confound subsequent assignment of adults to 'nursery' estuaries. Significant differences in elemental fingerprints (Sr, Ba and Mn) were found within and among estuaries, but there was often an interaction with time suggesting that there were differences among estuaries/sites but the difference varied between times. Quadratic discriminant functions (QDFs) generated to discriminate among estuaries suggested that the QDFs calculated from a single year class were more successful at assigning fish to the correct estuary than either (1) QDFs based on both years combined or (2) using the QDFs generated from the first year class to classify the second year class. Small-scale variability among sites within an estuary suggested that for an estuarine fishery we may be able to classify fish to their site of origin; this warrants further investigation. Adult fish from a coastal fishery can now be assigned to their 'nursery' estuary by analysing the juvenile region of their otoliths, provided that discriminant functions are generated from the appropriate year class of recruits.},

   abstract = {Acoustic telemetry and standard tag-recapture were used to determine the home range and residency of juveniles and sub-adults of Diplodus sargus and Diplodus vulgaris in the Ria Formosa (Portugal) coastal lagoon. Maximum time between recaptures for the standard tag-recapture method was 128 days for D. sargus and 30 days for D. vulgaris. The majority of the fish were recaptured in the vicinity of the tagging location. Fish tagged with acoustic transmitters had a maximum period of time between first and last detections of 62 days for D. sargus and 260 days for D. vulgaris. Minimum convex polygons areas ranged between 148 024 m2 and 525 930 m2 for D. sargus and between 23 786 m2 and 42 134 m2 for D. vulgaris. Both species presented a high residency index between first and last detections. Two D. sargus tagged with acoustic tags were recaptured by fishermen outside the coastal lagoon at distances of 12 km and 90 km from the tagging position, providing evidence that this species leaves the Ria Formosa during the winter time for the adjacent coastal waters. The results of this study reinforce the importance of Ria Formosa as a nursery for D. sargus and D. vulgaris in the south coast of Portugal. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Taking a longitudinal approach of following cohorts over time, we evaluated evidence for mangrove-derived replenishment of 10 coral reef fishes by drawing on data from 2 concurrent fish monitoring efforts conducted in Biscayne National Park, Florida, USA, over the period 1999 to 2007. Annual indices of abundance were calculated for fish estimated to be age-0 to 4+ in both habitats, and correlation analyses, with appropriate temporal lags, were performed. Statistically significant (p < 0.05; r2 = 0.30 to 0.71) correlations between juvenile abundances in mangrove habitats and adult abundances on the reef tract 1 to 2 yr later emerged for 4 species: Abudefduf saxatilis, Lutjanus apodus, L. griseus, and Sphyraena barracuda. This is one of the few longitudinal studies that uses juvenile abundance indices to test mangrove-reef ontogenetic connectivity. Our results have potential utility for nursery habitat assessment, marine reserve design, and for forecasting species-specific year-class strength on the reef, where most fishing is directed.

   abstract = {The objective of this study was to evaluate whether age-0 lane snapper Lutjanus synagris otolith chemical signatures could serve as accurate proxies for those of its congener, red snapper L. campechanus, among northern Gulf of Mexico (GOM) nursery regions. Red (n = 90) and lane (n = 53) snappers were sampled from 3 regions of the northern GOM in fall 2005, and their otolith chemistry was analyzed with sector field-inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (Ba:Ca, Mg:Ca, Mn:Ca, Sr:Ca, Li:Ca) or stable isotope ratio-mass spectrometry (δ13C and δ18O). Chemical signatures were significantly different among regions (MANOVA, p < 0.001) and between species (MANOVA, p = 0.029), with the species effect being driven by significant differences in 4 of the 7 constituents analyzed (ANOVA, p < 0.036). The significant region effect persisted (MANOVA, p < 0.001), but the species effect was non-significant (MANOVA, p = 0.964) when constituent values were normalized to species-specific means. Mean regional classification accuracies from linear discriminant functions computed with otolith constituent data were 84% for lane snapper and 80% for red snapper whether data were normalized or not. Maximum likelihood models parameterized with normalized lane snapper otolith chemistry data estimated red snapper regional composition reasonably well among mixed-region samples (mean error = 9.7% among models). Therefore, it appears age-0 lane snapper otolith chemical signatures can serve as accurate proxies for those of red snapper in the northern GOM. These results have broader implications for deriving natural tags based on otolith chemistry for fishes that may have low abundance in parts of their range. © The authors 2014.},

   abstract = {Abstract: Gray Snapper Lutjanus griseus are fished extensively by recreational anglers in inshore estuarine habitats and in coastal and nearshore reef habitats along Florida’s Gulf of Mexico coast. Although a detailed fishery assessment of Gray Snapper has never been conducted, there is a need for discard mortality estimates due to the large number of individuals captured by the recreational fishery. Our objective was to characterize discard mortality for the Gray Snapper recreational fishery in a study area that was representative of the regions in which most of the recreational fishing for this species takes place. In total, 247 Gray Snapper were caught during short-term (48-h) discard mortality experiments; 17 of the fish died, resulting in an overall mortality rate of 6.9%. Discard mortality was lower for fish caught from inshore waters (2/143 fish; 1.4%) than for those captured from the nearshore zone (15/104 fish; 14.4%). The water depth at the capture site and the anatomical hook location significantly influenced the probability of mortality. Individuals that were caught in shallower water and that were hooked in the lip were most likely to survive catch and release, whereas fish that were hooked in the esophagus were least likely to survive.

   abstract = {Increasing recognition of the complexity of environmental problems, and the need to understand social processes and human values, is leading environmental management agencies in many nations, including the USA, to integrate more research from the social sciences through the inclusion of social scientists on interdisciplinary teams. For this study we conducted focus groups at three research laboratories within the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's Office of Research and Development to better understand how inclusion of social sciences influenced the research process and outcomes, and the barriers to and facilitators of integration. The focus groups identified effects on the research process including improved problem framing, the introduction of new methodologies, and greater stakeholder and public inclusion, while research outcomes included the inclusion or refinement of social and environmental perspectives and systems thinking, increased translatability of research, and new partnerships. Barriers identified included lack of familiarity with social sciences which affected perceptions of social sciences and organizational capacity to absorb and apply social science expertise. Facilitators included receptivity of team members, intentional communication strategies, and project structures and organizational commitment that support interdisciplinary work. Finding a key barrier to be lack of clarity about the different roles social sciences play in translational research, we present a conceptual model defining the roles and contributions of social scientists that clarifies the distinction between “integration” of social sciences in research and “application” of skills and knowledge from the social sciences which play distinct but equally important roles in translational research approaches and solutions-driven research. These insights on the ways social sciences contribute to translational research efforts advance integration of social and natural sciences in environmental science research, particularly in applied contexts.},

In this article I discuss the limitations of using the ‘network’ metaphor in transdisciplinary research practice and propose the use of a different metaphor to make transdisciplinary research encounters more attuned to difference. This research is informed by Tim Ingold's use of ‘meshwork’ as a metaphor for how life is lived along lines of becoming: emergent, indeterminate, contingent, historical, narrative. In this paper, my objective is to explain and illustrate by way of an example of a transdisciplinary climate change adaptation project the need for a new metaphor to convey the open-endedness of transdisciplinary research where subject positions are not conceived in advance of a research encounter, such as in the ‘network’ metaphor, but erupt in the interstices of research methods, objectives and desired outcomes. The meshwork metaphor implies that transdisciplinarity should be reframed as a practice of attunement to difference, becoming skilled in paying attention, witnessing, and responding to differences.},

We evaluated the potential population-level impacts of commercial gill-net bycatch and recreational fishing mortality on black crappie Pomoxis nigromaculatus in Lake Dora, Florida. We assessed total black crappie bycatch and the mortality rates of black crappie entangled in gill nets, quantified recreational Fishing effort and harvest, and estimated exploitation for the recreational and commercial (bycatch) fisheries. We used in equilibrium age-structured population model to assess potential population-level impacts, of bycatch and recreational fishing mortality. Onboard observer data of commercial fishers showed that about 17,000 and 30,000 black, crappie were captured in gill nets in 2005 and 2006, respectively. Cage experiments revealed that about 30% and 47% of black crappie captured in gill nets experienced mortality after 72 h in 2005 and 2006. respectively. The recreational fishery exploitation rate was estimated to be 42% based on angler tag returns in 2006. and commercial exploitation via bycatch from commercial gill nets was 15%. The population model suggested that the level of recreational fishing mortality observed in 2006 was probably sustainable but that additional commercial or recreational exploitation would create it risk of recruitment overfishing. The greatest risk for recruitment overfishing via bycatch occurs when other sources of exploitation are also high (e.g.. via a recreational fishery).},

   abstract = {Knowledge of trophic interactions between the key components of marine communities is required to understand food-web dynamics and develop ecosystem-based management approaches. In West Africa, where fisheries sustain the livelihoods of a significant part of the human population, this understanding is even more urgent, especially in the face of rapidly expanding fisheries and some stock collapses in the region. We studied the feeding ecology of the Crevalle jack Caranx hippos, West African Spanish mackerel Scomberomorus tritor and Guinean barracuda Sphyraena afra in the Bijagós Archipelago, Guinea-Bissau. These are the most abundant pelagic predatory teleost fishes in the area, but little is known about their ecology despite being species with commercial and recreational value, and they likely also play an important role in various African coastal ecosystems. Our findings show a high degree of dietary overlap among these three predator species, despite some degree of segregation by prey size and type. All three predators depend on Sardinella maderensis as the most important prey, which together with other members of the Clupeidae represented 47–96% of the ingested prey items. There was little difference in the diets of the predators between the dry and rainy seasons. These novel findings suggest a ‘wasp-waist’-structured ecosystem in the Bijagós Archipelago in which S. maderensis is the central small-sized pelagic fish species, and stress the need for an ecosystem-based approach to fisheries management in the region, with precautionary measures taken to avoid the overexploitation of clupeids.},

   abstract = {In der Fischereiforschung wurde entdeckt, dass die Habitatsituation in Schweizer Fliessgewässern, eine parasitäre Fischerkrankung und Fischereimanagement höchst wahrscheinlich verantwortlich für abnehmende Fischfänge sind. Bezogen auf das Fischereimanagement können Hobby-Fischer (oder Angler) in der Schweiz als Hauptakteure bezeichnet werden, da sie aktiv in die Bewirtschaftung der Gewässer eingebunden sind. Eine sehr verbreitete und übliche Bewirtschaftungsmassnahme ist der sogenannte Fischbesatz (oder kurz: Besatz). Darunter wird das intentionale, meist im grossen Stil durchgeführte Aussetzen von Fischen in Zielgewässer verstanden. Die Besatzfische werden meist in Aufzuchtsbächen oder in Zuchtanlagen aufgezogen. Hauptmotive für Besatz sind die Verringerung von durch den Menschen verursachte Störungen des Lebensraums, Wiederherstellung von Fischstämmen, Arterhaltung angestammter Arten und die Erhöhung des eigenen Angelertrages. Besatzmassnahmen sind bei Schweizer Anglern sehr populär und es gibt Hinweise darauf, dass Angler den Nutzen von Besatz überbewerten. Andererseits betrachten Ökologen und anderen Wissenschaftler aus dem Bereich der Fischerei Besatzmassnahmen kritisch, da Besatzmassnahmen das Potential zugeschrieben wird durch Konkurrenz, den Verlust von genetischer und adaptiver Vielfalt und die Verbreitung von Krankheiten und/oder Parasiten angestammte Arten und deren Erhaltung zu bedrohen bzw. zu gefährden.\nIn der vorliegenden Arbeit sollen die Meinungen und Überzeugungen, die Angler in bezug auf Besatz haben, beleuchtet werden. Besonderes Augenmerk wird hierbei auf die Bachforelle (Salmo trutta) gelegt, da diese zu denjenigen Fischarten gehört, die von Schweizer Anglern bevorzugt werden. Neben der reinen Erhebung und Analyse dieser mentalen Modelle von Anglern zielt dies Forschungsprojekt ebenfalls darauf ab, die mentalen Modelle, die Angler zu Forellen und Besatzmassnahmen haben, zu verändern und damit umweltgerechteres Handeln zu fördern – sofern eine Änderung angebracht ist.\nDas Projekt, auf dem diese Dissertation basiert, war als interdisziplinäres Forschungsprojekt angelegt. Es bestand aus drei Projektabschnitten, in die jeweils Anteile aus der Fischerei- wissenschaft und der Psychologie eingeflossen sind.\nIm ersten Projektabschnitt wurde ein qualitativer Ansatz gewählt, um die mentalen Modelle, die Angler bezüglich Bachforellen, deren Ansprüchen an den Lebensraum und bezüglich Besatzmassnahmen haben, zu erheben und zu analysieren (N = 12). Eine schweizweite Fragebogenumfrage (N = 418) mit dem Hauptziel, die Ergebnisse aus der ersten Etappe zu validieren und zu erweitern, wurde im zweiten Projektabschnitt durchgeführt. Seitens der fischereiwissenschaftlichen Projektbeteiligung wurde in dieser Etappe Expertenwissen (basierend auf Literaturrecherchen) zu Besatzmassnahmen, Bachforellen und deren Ansprüchen an den Lebensraum zusammengestellt. Im dritten Projektabschnitt wurden Besatz-Erfolgskontrollen mit sechs verschiedenen Angelvereinen durchgeführt. Die Besatz- Erfolgskontrollen wurden zusammen mit den Ergebnissen aus den ersten beiden Projektabschnitten genutzt, um ein Interventionsprojekt zu planen, dass darauf abzielen sollte, die mentalen Modelle der Angler bezüglich Besatz zu verändern, sofern eine Veränderung angebracht sei. Das Interventionsprojekt war so gestaltet, dass die Angler aktiv in die Besatzerfolgskontrollen eingebunden waren und detaillierte Rückmeldungen zum Besatzerfolg (durch Berichte und während eines Abschlussworkshops) bekamen. Die Wirkung des Interventionsprogramms wurde mittels wiederholter Befragungen per Fragebogen erhoben, bezogen auf den Workshop wurden Ergebnisprotokolle auf einem Flipchart festgehalten.\nAls Hauptergebnisse wurden in der ersten, qualitativen Projektetappe ein additives und ein kompensatorisches mentales Modell zu Besatz und Forellenbeständen identifiziert. Das additive mentale Modell besagt hauptsächlich, dass Besatzmassnahmen unabhängig vom Ausmass der natürlichen Fortpflanzung von Bachforellen durchgeführt werden sollten, während das kompensatorische mentale Modell den Bedarf von Besatzmassnahmen vom Ausmass der natürlichen Fortpflanzung bei Bachforellen abhängig macht. Es postuliert, dass der Bedarf an Besatzmassnahmen sinkt, je besser das Ausmass der natürlichen Fortpflanzung bei Bachforellen ist. In der zweiten Projektetappe konnten diese beiden mentalen Modelle in einer grösseren, schweizweiten Anglerstichprobe wiedergefunden werden. In den Ergebnissen hat sich gezeigt, dass das additive mentale Modell bei Schweizer Anglern weit verbreitet ist, da ca. 2/3 der befragten Angler den additiven Denkstrukturen zugeordnet werden konnten. Des weiteren konnte das additive mentale Modell mit einer positiveren Einstellung zu Besatz in Verbindung gebracht werden, ebenso wie mit einer höheren Funktionalität in Bezug auf die Erreichung von Bewirtschaftungszielen in der Fischerei, einer geringeren umweltgerechten Orientierung und einer geringeren Risikowahrnehmung bezüglich Besatz im Vergleich zum kompensatorischen Modell.\nHauptergebnisse der Besatzerfolgskontrollen im dritten Projektabschnitt waren, dass je zwei Vereinen aufgrund der biologischen Ergebnisse empfohlen werden konnte, mit Besatzmassnahmen weiterzumachen, die Besatzmassnahmen anzupassen beziehungsweise mit Besatzmassnahmen aufzuhören. Bezogen auf das durchgeführte Interventionsprojekt kann geschlussfolgert werden, dass es nicht gelungen ist, die additiven mentalen Modelle durch Intervention in kompensatorische mentale Modelle zu überführen. Allerdings konnten Veränderungstendenzen in relevanten psychologischen Bereichen ausgemacht werden und vier der sechs teilnehmende Vereine folgten den Projektempfehlungen teilweise oder sogar vollständig in Bezug auf zukünftige Besatzmassnahmen.\nInsgesamt kann festgehalten werden, dass die befragten Schweizer Angler sehr detaillierte mental Modelle zu Bachforellen, deren Lebensraumanforderungen und zu Besatzmassnahmen hatten, die die meisten relevanten Aspekte des zusammengestellten Expertenwissens gut abdeckten. Darüber hinaus hat sich bestätigt, dass der Ansatz, mentale Modelle zu analysieren sehr vielversprechend ist und ein umfangreiches Verständnis zu den Vorstellungen von Anglern bezüglich Besatzmassnahmen und Prozessen in Fliessgewässerökosystemen fördert. Auch wenn aufgrund des Interventionsprogramms keine signifikanten Veränderungen beobachtet werden konnten, hat die Interventionsstudie dennoch wertvolle Einsichten zur Rolle der Funktionalität mentaler Modelle für Theorie und Interventionsplanung vermittelt.},

   abstract = {U.S. fisheries management has made tremendous strides under the current management framework, which centers on single stocks rather than ecosystems. However, conventional management focuses on one fishing sector at a time, considers a narrow range of issues, and is separated into individual fishery management plans often leaving little opportunity to consider overarching management goals across fisheries. Ecosystem-based Fisheries Management (EBFM) provides mechanisms to address these but has not been widely adopted. Here, we review and analyze the development of Fisheries Ecosystem Plans (FEPs) as a means to implement EBFM. In doing so, we provide a blueprint for next-generation FEPS that have the potential to translate EBFM to action. We highlight FEPs as a structured planning process that uses adaptive management to operationalize EBFM. This “FEP Loop” process starts by identifying the key factors that shape a fishery system and considering them simultaneously, as a coherent whole. It then helps managers and stakeholders delineate their overarching goals for the system and refine them into specific, realistic projects. And it charts a course forward with a set of management actions that work in concert to achieve the highest-priority objectives. We conclude that EBFM is feasible today using existing science tools, policy instruments, and management structures. Not only that, nearly all of the steps in the proposed “FEP Loop” process are presently being carried out by U.S. fishery managers. The process of reviewing regional experiences in developing and applying the FEP loop will lead to adaptations and improvements of the process we propose.},

   abstract = {Fuzzy Cognitive Maps (FCM) have found favor in a variety of theoretical and applied contexts that span the hard and soft sciences. Given the utility and flex-ibility of the method, coupled with the broad appeal of FCM to a variety of sci-entific disciplines, FCM have been appropriated in many different ways and, depending on the academic discipline in which it has been applied, used to draw a range of conclusions about the belief systems of individuals and groups. Alt-hough these cognitive maps have proven useful as a method to systematically collect and represent knowledge, questions about the cognitive theories which support these assumptions remain. Detailed instructions about how to interpret FCM, especially in terms of collective knowledge and the construction of FCM by non-traditional 'experts', are also currently lacking. Drawing from the social science literature and the recent application of FCM as a tool for collaborative decision-making, in this chapter we attempt to clarify some of these ambigui-ties. Specifically, we address a number of theoretical issues regarding the use of Fuzzy Cognitive Mapping to represent individual " mental models " as well as their utility for comparing and characterizing the aggregated beliefs and knowledge of a community.},

Mental models research offers a suite of methods that can be used to reveal these understandings and how they might affect conservation outcomes. Mental models are representations in people's minds of how parts of the world work. We seek to demonstrate their value to conservation and assist practitioners and researchers in navigating the choices of methods available to elicit them. We begin by explaining some of the dominant applications of mental models in conservation: revealing individual assumptions about a system, developing a stakeholder-based model of the system, and creating a shared pathway to conservation. We then provide a framework to “walk through” the stepwise decisions in mental models research, with a focus on diagram-based methods. Finally, we discuss some of the limitations of mental models research and application that are important to consider.

Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-α-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 Å for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21% with default Glide SP settings to 58% with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63% success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40% of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

   abstract = {Final ecosystemservices (i.e. services that directly benefit humanity) depend fundamentally upon the various processes, regulated by organisms, which underpin ecosystem functioning and maintain ecosystem structures. Such processes include inter alia primary productivity, detritus decomposition, pollination, soil formation, and nutrient uptake and fixation. Insights into the abiotic, biotic, and spatial factors regulating these "supporting ecosystem processes" have arisen from within multiple fields of ecology which have not always been well integrated, including research on biodiversity-ecosystem functioning (B-EF) and biodiversity-ecosystem service (B-ES) relationships, meta-ecosystem ecology, and ecological resilience. Here, we draw together insights from these fields towards a framework suitable for addressing impacts of human disturbances on ecosystem processes and the services they support. We further discuss application of portfolio theory and a trait-based framework as unifying approaches in the assessment and management of ecosystem functioning and services, and identify a set of "resilience attributes" useful for assessing the resilience of ecosystem structure, functioning, and service delivery. Finally, we discuss future research challenges and opportunities, including uncertainties involved in linking species traits and interactions with ecosystem functioning and services. We conclude that the necessary theory and tools are already in place to begin the unification of B-EF, B-ES, meta-ecosystem, and resilience frameworks and to test their application in the assessment and management of ecosystem services. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Numerous metrics have been applied to quantify resilience over a range of ecosystems. However, the way resilience is quantified affects the degree to which different trajectories of ecosystem recovery from disturbance are represented as ‘resilient’ precluding a comparison of disturbance responses across ecosystems and their properties and functions. To approach a broadly comparable assessment of resilience we suggest using a bivariate framework that jointly considers the disturbance impact and the recovery rate, both normalized to the undisturbed state of a system. We demonstrate the potential of the framework for attribution and integration across the various components underlying resilience.},

   abstract = {Each family of the desert isopod Hemilepistus reaumuri uses its faeces to build an embankment around its burrow entrance in the form of a ring with an inner radius of 5-10 cm and an outer radius of 8-15 cm. Although the embankment, like the burrow entrance, is detected only by contact with the antennae, it facilitates the return to the burrow after an excursion. When a desert isopod returns from foraging it reaches the burrow entrance itself (diameter 12 mm) only in ca. 12% of the observed cases by "dead reckoning"; the embankment, however, is reached six times more frequently. After detecting this landmark an isopod needs a further 12% of the pathlength of the preceding excursion to locate the burrow entrance. In contrast, it travels five times further to reach its burrow from the same distance (10 cm) if the landmark is missing. The landmark is even more important when the isopod, because of a large error in orientation, can reach its burrow only by searching. Both the characteristics of the search path of H. reaumuri and the success of it's search behaviour correspond well to the respective features of a theoretical procedure, which best solves the search problem of the desert isopods assuming that a landmark is available for orientation. The optimal search procedure was calculated by using information about the probability density that an error in orientation has a given size, and the cumulative probability that the landmark is detected if the isopod searches in it's region with a given intensity. The coupling of the systematic search strategy of H. reaumuri with landmark orientation shortens the average time needed for homing by one-third. It helps an isopod to return to it's burrow after foraging even if all the orientation mechanisms normally used for this task have broken down.},

In addition, diversity and connectivity are principles that have been studied. Climate change in rural coastal regions is the most common stressor that has been studied, and the human dimension of such systems is the dominant focus. Systems interactions, feedbacks and thresholds are rarely identified or assessed. In addition, attributes of the system primarily using indicators are preferred over analysing causal relationships with models.

In the present article, we review how discoveries from the US Long Term Ecological Research (LTER) Network have influenced theoretical paradigms in disturbance ecology, and we refine a framework for describing social-ecological disturbance that addresses these three challenges. By operationalizing this framework for seven LTER sites spanning distinct biomes, we show how disturbance can maintain or alter ecosystem state, drive spatial patterns at landscape scales, influence social-ecological interactions, and cause divergent outcomes depending on other environmental changes.},

We suggest that a resilience-based management approach facilitates regional planning by providing the ability to locate management actions where they will have the greatest benefits and determine effective management strategies. We review the six key components of a resilience-based approach, beginning with managing for adaptive capacity and selecting an appropriate spatial extent and grain. Critical elements include developing an understanding of the factors influencing the general and ecological resilience of ecosystems and landscapes, the landscape context and spatial resilience, pattern and process interactions and their variability, and relationships among ecological and spatial resilience and the capacity to support habitats and species. We suggest that a spatially explicit approach, which couples geospatial information on general and spatial resilience to disturbance with information on resources, habitats, or species, provides the foundation for resilience-based management. We provide a case study from the sagebrush biome that illustrates the use of geospatial information on ecological and spatial resilience for prioritizing management actions and determine effective strategies.},

This framework explicitly advocates that what is often divided into "natural" and human systems be considered a single, complex social-ecological system (SES). In this paper, we propose a list of core social science research areas, concepts, and questions; identify the need for multiscale investigatory frameworks crucial for implementing integrated research; and suggest practical approaches for integration. In sum, this paper is a general outline for empirical and cross-site research projects where investigators agree that bringing together social, biological, and earth scientists can lead to synthetic approaches and a unified understanding of the mechanisms regulating SES. Although the motivation for this goal is specific to the LTER Network and similar projects, we believe that the issues and ideas presented here are widely applicable to other interdisciplinary SES studies.},

   abstract = {Genetic analyses of marine population structure often find only slight geographic differentiation in species with high dispersal potential. Interpreting the significance of this slight genetic signal has been difficult because even mild genetic structure implies very limited demographic exchange between populations, but slight differentiation could also be due to sampling error. Examination of genetic isolation by distance, in which close populations are more similar than distant ones, has the potential to increase confidence in the significance of slight genetic differentiation. Simulations of one-dimensional stepping stone populations with particular larval dispersal regimes shows that isolation by distance is most obvious when comparing populations separated by 2-5 times the mean larval dispersal distance. Available data on fish and invertebrates can be calibrated with this simulation approach and suggest mean dispersal distances of 25-150 km. Design of marine reserve systems requires an understanding of larval transport in and out of reserves, whether reserves will be self-seeding, whether they will accumulate recruits from surrounding exploited areas, and whether reserve networks can exchange recruits. Direct measurements of mean larval dispersal are needed to understand connectivity in a reserve system, but such measurements are extremely difficult. Genetic patterns of isolation by distance have the potential to add to direct measurement of larval dispersal distance and can help set the appropriate geographic scales on which marine reserve systems will function well.},

   abstract = {Caye Glory and Gladden Spit in Belize, and Grand Cayman East (GCE) and Little Cayman West (LCW) in the Cayman Islands, have a common geomorphologic signature and all harbor important breeding grounds for commercially important reef fishes. Most commercially important reef fishes, including many species of grouper and snapper, travel relatively long distances over the course of days or weeks to aggregate and spawn at very specific times and in very specific places. Locations of known sites were compiled using published literature and new field surveys and indicate commonality in the underlying geomorphology and species seasonality of reef fish spawning aggregation (FSA) sites throughout the wider Caribbean. Commercially important reef fish such as grouper and snapper use specific geomorphologic locations as spawning grounds throughout the wider Caribbean. In the Cayman Islands and Belize, fish choose shelf-edge reef promontories for spawning, and share these areas with other species. These multispecies spawning aggregation sites are generally located near the inflection points of convex-shaped reefs, in 20-40 m water depth, adjacent to sharp shelf edges where water depth drops to several hundred meters. Reef geomorphology may be the key determinant for the selection of reef fish breeding habitat.

Three possible aggregation sites were selected for monitoring based on satellite images, low-cost bathymetric mapping and interviews with experienced local fishermen. Abundances and sizes of 18 species that are known to form reproductive aggregations were monitored at these sites using underwater visual census for 7 days after each full moon from February to August, 2007. While spawning events were not observed, possible indirect evidence of spawning aggregations was found for Lutjanus analis at Cayo Sal and Boca de Sebastopol, Lutjanus apodus at Cayo Sal, Lutjanus cyanopterus at Cayo Sal and Piedra La Guasa and Epinephelus guttatus at Bajo California and Cayo de Agua. Additionally, indirect evidence was identified for the past existence of a spawning aggregation of Epinephelus striatus in the northern part of the archipelago, which may have been eliminated by overfishing c.15 years ago. Bathymetric mapping showed that the shelf edge at sites monitored in this study was shallower than at spawning aggregation sites in other parts of the Caribbean, and that sites were not proximal to deep water. While this study does not prove the existence or locations of spawning aggregations of reef fishes in the archipelago, it does add insight to a growing understanding of generalities in the relationship between seafloor characteristics and the locations of transient reef-fish spawning aggregations in the Caribbean. © 2010 The Authors.

Eulerian and Lagrangian flow models, coupled with linear mortality estimates, were used to examine this assumption. The findings show that when simple advection models are used, larval exchange rates may be overestimated; such simplistic models fail to account for a decrease of up to nine orders of magnitude in larval concentrations resulting from diffusion and mortality. The alternative process of larval retention near local populations is shown to exist and may be of great importance in the maintenance of marine population structure and management of coastal marine resources.},

These fish spawning aggregations (FSAs) can be highly vulnerable to concentrated fishing pressure, which can have detrimental effects on entire stocks and ecosystems. There has been only limited research and management attention on FSAs in the U.S. GOM. We synthesized available information on FSA locations, spawning seasonality, and fisheries management for 28 regionally important species known or likely to form FSAs in the U.S. GOM. We identified and mapped 22 multi-species FSA sites which all fall within areas predicted from recently published FSA distribution models. But the number of known sites is probably far less than the number that actually exist. Only three of the 22 (13%) FSA sites were located within no-take marine protected areas and none were in state waters. Management measures (e.g., seasonal closures or gear restrictions) to protect spawning fishes are also limited, particularly in state waters. We recommend expanded cooperative research efforts to characterize FSAs in the U.S. GOM in order to assist managers in prioritizing sites and seasons for additional protection. Important multi-species FSAs can be incorporated in a network of monitored and managed “sentinel” sites. These efforts should build stakeholder engagement in the management process, generate data that can be used to improve fisheries stock assessments, contribute to developing ecosystem-based fisheries management approaches, and confer resilience to important fisheries stocks and ecosystems of the U.S. GOM.},

Generalized additive models (GAMs) were used to explore complex relationships between carangid abundance and physical oceanographic data of sea surface temperature (SST), sea surface height anomaly (SSHA) and salinity. The five most abundant carangid species collected were: Selene setapinnis (34%); Caranx crysos (30%); Caranx hippos (10%); Chloroscombrus chrysurus (9%) and Trachurus lathami (8%). Post-larval carangids (median standard length [SL] = 10 mm) were less abundant during the spring and early summer, but more abundant during the late summer and fall, suggesting summer to fall spawning for most species. Juvenile carangid (median SL = 23 mm) abundance also increased between the mid-summer and early fall. Most species showed increased abundance at lower salinities and higher temperatures, suggesting entrainment of post-larval fishes or feeding aggregations of juveniles at frontal convergence zones between the expansive river plume and dynamic mesoscale eddy water masses. However, responses were species- and life-stage specific, which may indicate fine-scale habitat partitioning between species. Ordination methods also revealed higher carangid abundances at lower salinities for both post-larval and juvenile life stages, with species- and life-stage specific responses to SST and SSHA, further suggesting habitat separation between species. Results indicate strong links between physical oceanographic features and carangid distributions in the dynamic northern GoM.},

Using a high-resolution biophysical model for the Caribbean region, we report that typical larval dispersal distances of ecologically relevant magnitudes are on the scale of only 10 to 100 kilometers for a variety of reef fish species. We also show the importance of the early onset of active larval movement mediating the dispersal potential. In addition to self-recruitment, larval import from outside the local area is required to sustain most populations, although these population subsidies are very limited in particular systems. The results reveal distinct regions of population isolation based on larval dispersal that also correspond to genetic and morphological dines observed across a range of marine organisms.},

   abstract = {Spatial connectivity is an essential process to consider in the design and assessment of Marine Protected Areas (MPAs). To help maintain and restore marine populations and communities MPAs should form ecologically coherent networks. How to estimate and implement connectivity in MPA design remains a challenge. Here a new theoretical framework is presented based on biophysical modelling of organism dispersal, combined with a suite of tools to assess different aspects of connectivity that can be integrated in MPA design. As a demonstration, these tools are applied to an MPA network in the Baltic Sea (HELCOM MPA). The tools are based on the connectivity matrix, which summarizes dispersal probabilities, averaged over many years, between all considered areas in the geographic target area. The biophysical model used to estimate connectivity included important biological traits that affect dispersal patterns where different trait combinations and habitat preferences will produce specific connectivity matrices representing different species. Modelled connectivity matrices were used to assess local retention within individual MPAs, which offers indications about the adequacy of size when MPAs are considered in isolation. The connectivity matrix also provides information about source areas to individual MPAs, e.g. sources of larvae or pressures such as contaminants. How well several MPAs act as a network was assessed within a framework of eigenvalue perturbation theory (EPT). With EPT, the optimal MPA network with respect to connectivity can be identified. In addition, EPT can suggest optimal extensions of existing MPA networks to enhance connectivity. Finally, dispersal barriers can be identified based on the connectivity matrix, which may suggest boundaries for management units. The assessment of connectivity for the HELCOM MPA are discussed in terms of possible improvements, but the tools presented here could be applied to any region.},

   abstract = {We explore how alternative hypotheses on the degree of mixing among local subpopulations affect statistical inferences on the dynamics and stock assessment of a harvested flatfish population, namely, the common sole population in the Eastern Channel (ICES area VIId). The current paradigm considers a single, well-mixed, spatially homogeneous population with juveniles from all coastal nursery grounds along the French and UK coasts that contribute to a single adult population and one pool of eggs. Based on the available data and ecological knowledge, we developed a spatial Bayesian integrated life-cycle model that consists of three subpopulations (one near the UK coast and two near the French coast, denoted UK, West FR and East FR, respectively) supported by their respective local nurseries, with the connectivity among the three components limited to low exchanges during larval drift. Considering the population dynamics among three subpopulations (instead of a single homogeneous one) drastically changes our inferences on the productivity of nursery sectors and their relative contribution to total recruitment. Estimates of the East FR subpopulation's contribution to total recruitment increase (29% in the single population model; 48% in the three subpopulation model), balanced by a decrease in the UK subpopulation's contribution (53%; 34%). Whereas an assessment based on the hypothesis of a single spatially homogeneous population in the EC indicates exploitation far above MSY (current F/FMSY = 1.8), an assessment that considers a metapopulation with three loosely connected subpopulations revealed a different status, with the UK and East FR subpopulations being exploited above MSY (current F/FMSY = 1.9 and 2, respectively) and the West FR subpopulation approaching full exploitation (current F/FMSY = 1.05). This approach contributes to the quantitative assessment of spatial fishery and coastal habitat management plans.},

However, management boundaries tend to be static and determined by politically negotiated or historically identified population (or multi-species) units, which create a potential disconnect with underlying, dynamic population structure. The consequences of incoherent management and population or stock boundaries were explored through the application of a two-area spatial simulation–estimation framework. Results highlight the importance of aligning management assessment areas with underlying population structure and processes, especially when fishing mortality is disproportionate to vulnerable biomass among management areas, demographic parameters (growth and maturity) are not homogenous within management areas, and connectivity (via recruitment or movement) unknowingly exists among management areas. Bias and risk were greater for assessments that incorrectly span multiple population segments (PSs) compared to assessments that cover a subset of a PS, and these results were exacerbated when there was connectivity between PSs. Directed studies and due consideration of critical PSs, spatially explicit models, and dynamic management options that help align management and population boundaries would likely reduce estimation biases and management risk, as would closely coordinated management that functions across population boundaries.},

Location: The Mediterranean Sea, where sea surface temperatures are expected to strongly increase by the end of the 21st century, represents an archetypal situation with a dense MPA network but resource overexploitation outside. Methods: Using an individual-based mechanistic model of larval transport, forced with an emission-driven regional climate change scenario for the Mediterranean Sea, we explored the combined effects of changes in hydrodynamics, adult reproductive timing and larval dispersal on the connectivity among MPAs and their ability to seed fished areas with larvae. Results: We show that, over the period 1970-2099, larval dispersal distances would decrease by 10%, the continental shelf area seeded with larvae would decrease by 3% and the larval retention fraction would increase by 5%, resulting in higher concentration of larvae in smaller areas of the continental shelf. However, connectance within the MPA network would increase by 5% as more northern MPAs would become suitable for reproduction with increasing temperatures. We also show that the effects of changes in adult reproductive timing and larval dispersal on connectivity patterns are additive. Main conclusions: Climate change will influence connectivity and the effectiveness of MPA networks, and should receive more attention in future conservation planning and large-scale population dynamics.},

Although pure metapopulations may be rare, there are many empirical studies in which metapopulation pro- cesses, primarily local colonization and extinction, have been useful in explaining dynamics of natural and experimental systems. Metapopulation ecology is used in conservation biology and in population genetics where it influences genetic structure, the rate and trajectory of evolution and even what traits are under selection. Final- ly, communities of species that are distributed in a land- scape potentially form metacommunity, which is a concept that shares important characteristics with metapopulations.},

   abstract = {Marine and fisheries scientists are increasingly using metapopulation concepts to better understand and model their focal systems. Consequently, they are considering what defines a metapopulation. One perspective on this question emphasizes the importance of extinction probability in local populations. This view probably stems from the focus on extinction in Levins' original metapopulation model, but places unnecessary emphasis on extinction- recolonization dynamics. Metapopulation models with more complex structure than Levins' patch-occupancy model and its variants allow a broader range of population phenomena to be examined, such as changes in population size, age structure and genetic structure. Analyses along these lines are critical in fisheries science, where presence-absence resolution is far too coarse to understand stock dynamics in a meaningful way. These more detailed investigations can, but need not, aim to assess extinction risk or deal with extinction-prone local populations. Therefore, we emphasize the coupling of spatial scales as the defining feature of metapopulations. It is the degree of demographic connectivity that characterizes metapopulations, with the dynamics of local populations strongly dependent upon local demographic processes, but also influenced by a nontrivial element of external replenishment. Therefore, estimating rates of interpopulation exchange must be a research priority. We contrast metapopulations with other spatially structured populations that differ in the degree of local closure of their component populations. We conclude with consideration of the implications of metapopulation structure for spatially explicit management, particularly the design of marine protected area networks.},

Based on this synoptic survey, we produced a spatial map of Red Snapper relative abundance that integrates both gear selectivity effects and ontogenetically varying habitat usage. Our methodology generated a spatial map of Red Snapper at a 10-km2 grid resolution that is consistent with existing knowledge of the species: Red Snapper occurred in relatively high abundances at depths of 50–90 m along the coasts of Texas and Louisiana and in smaller, patchy “hot spots” at a variety of depths along the Alabama coast and the west Florida shelf. Red Snapper biomass and fecundity estimates were higher for the northwestern GOM than for the northeastern GOM, as the latter area contained mostly smaller, younger individuals. The existence of similar surveys on petroleum platforms and artificial reefs also enabled us to calculate their relative contribution to Red Snapper distribution compared with that of natural habitats.We estimated that for the youngest ageclasses, catch rates were approximately 20 times higher on artificial structures than on natural reefs. Despite the high catch rates observed on artificial structures, they represent only a small fraction of the total area in the northern GOM; thus, we estimated that they held less than 14% of Red Snapper abundance. Because artificial structures—particularly petroleum platforms—attractmostly the youngest individuals, their contribution was even lower in terms of total population biomass (7.8%) or spawning potential (6.4%). Our estimates of Red Snapper relative abundance, biomass, and spawning potential can be used to design spatial management strategies or as inputs to spatial modeling techniques.},

   abstract = {Snapper, Chrysophrys auratus, is a highly important fishery resource of southern Australia. Through the late 2000s, the State of South Australia (SA) produced record commercial catches of this species, making the dominant contribution to the national catch. This was associated with dramatic changes in contributions from SA's regional fisheries. The demographic processes responsible for these unprecedented changes were not understood, reflecting poor understanding of large-scale movement of snapper and its influence on regional population dynamics and stock structure. This study used otolith chemistry to investigate the movement behaviour and stock structure of snapper in the eastern part of southern Australia. Transverse sections of otoliths from four year classes and six geographic regions distributed over 1500 km of coastline were sampled by continuous life-history profiles across the chronological structure using laser ablation inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry. Element:calcium ratios were integrated with annual increment measurements to produce profiles of age-related, annual averages for Ba:Ca, Sr:Ca, Mn:Ca and Mg:Ca. Significant regional differences for each annual zone were used to infer differences in fish origins and inter-regional movement. Variation in Ba:Ca was most informative and indicated that an episodic fishery along the south east coastal region of SA is linked to periods of stock range expansion, involving movement over 600 km, from a major nursery area, Port Phillip Bay (PPB), in the adjacent state of Victoria. Periods of stock range expansion coincided with exceptionally strong year-classes originating from spawning in PPB. Inferences from the element:calcium profiles and other information suggested that the populations in the northern parts of the two gulfs of SA appear to be separate, self-recruiting and independent of inter-regional movement. Each, however, is an important nursery area and source of emigration that replenishes regional populations in adjacent coastal waters. The results support SA's snapper fishery being divided into three stocks, each dependent on a primary nursery area. The source for the intermittent fishery in the south east region of SA is within a separate management jurisdiction (Victoria), necessitating consideration of multi-jurisdictional assessment and management. We hypothesise that density-related processes are responsible for range expansion of this multi-jurisdictional stock, with strong year classes producing more extensive emigration and range expansion into SA waters. The study provides an example of the value of life-history otolith chemistry profiles for resolving stock structure at regional scales with implications for fisheries assessment and management.},

   abstract = {Purpose of Review: Resilience is a key concept to deal with an uncertain future in forestry. In recent years, it has received increasing attention from both research and practice. However, a common understanding of what resilience means in a forestry context and how to operationalise it is lacking. Here, we conducted a systematic review of the recent forest science literature on resilience in the forestry context, synthesizing how resilience is defined and assessed. Recent Findings: Based on a detailed review of 255 studies, we analysed how the concepts of engineering resilience, ecological resilience and social-ecological resilience are used in forest sciences. A clear majority of the studies applied the concept of engineering resilience, quantifying resilience as the recovery time after a disturbance. The two most used indicators for engineering resilience were basal area increment and vegetation cover, whereas ecological resilience studies frequently focus on vegetation cover and tree density. In contrast, important social-ecological resilience indicators used in the literature are socio-economic diversity and stock of natural resources. In the context of global change, we expected an increase in studies adopting the more holistic social-ecological resilience concept, but this was not the observed trend. Summary: Our analysis points to the nestedness of these three resilience concepts, suggesting that they are complementary rather than contradictory. It also means that the variety of resilience approaches does not need to be an obstacle for operationalisation of the concept. We provide guidance for choosing the most suitable resilience concept and indicators based on the management, disturbance and application context.},

   abstract = {The current concept of stock does not sufficiently accommodate the effects of migration behavior on population dynamics. New insight on the prevalence and ecological significance of divergent migrations within stocks has arisen through advancing technologies in tracking fishes. In particular, otolith elemental analysis may provide unique perspective on divergent migrations within stocks. Using otolith elemental fingerprints of Hudson River striped bass (Morone saxatilis), I evaluated Clark's (Clark, J.,1968. Trans. Am. Fish. Soc. 97, 320-343.) contingent hypothesis of intrapopulation migratory groups. Similar to the results of Clark's earlier tagging study, I observed three spatially discrete cohorts of Hudson River striped bass. An intriguing question is, if such contingents exist, then how are they regulated? Using frameworks for understanding smoltification in salmonids and ontogenetic niche shifts, I hypothesized that early life decisions regarding energy allocation lead to later divergence in habitat shifts (migration). This mechanism results in the maintenance of 'retentive' and 'exploratory' behaviors and contributes to features of population regulation including persistence, range contraction and expansion, and colonization. Support for the contingent hypothesis, i.e. divergent migration tactics, exists for a diverse array of fish taxa. Assignment of contingents should allow improved specification of factors which affect a population's accessibility to human impacts. Consideration of stock structure should incorporate a hierarchy of biological levels which evaluate both lineage (sub-population-population-meta-population-sub-species-species) and accessibility (individual-brood-school/shoal-year class-contingent).},

Based on the information about small yellow croaker (Larimichthys polyactis) off the coast of China, we simulated a fish population consisting of three subpopulations mixing at intermediate levels, which was considered in the "true" spatial structure of the population in this study. Three scenarios of population spatial structure were assumed in assessing and managing this simulated fishery: (i) metapopulation, which has the same structure as the "true" population; (ii) three independent subpopulations, which overlook the exchanges among the subpopulations; and (iii) unit population, which completely ignores the population spatial structure. Corresponding approaches were applied to assess and manage each of these assumed fish populations. The management time period was assumed to be 10 years with two harvesting levels (i.e., maximum sustainable yield (MSY) and f0.1). Assessing and managing the metapopulation as several independent populations could lead to a high probability of overexploitation. Managing the metapopulation as a unit population could lead to local depletion. Use of MSY as a management target may be risk prone in the existence of a metapopulation, and use of a fishing mortality lower than f0.1 as a management target is more desirable.},

Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-α-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 Å for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21% with default Glide SP settings to 58% with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63% success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40% of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

   abstract = {Marine reserves are expected to benefit a wide range of species, but most models used to evaluate their effects assume that adults are sedentary, thereby potentially overestimating population persistence. Many nearshore marine organisms move within a home range as adults, and there is a need to understand the effects of this type of movement on reserve performance. We incorporated movement within a home range into a spatially explicit marine reserve model in order to assess the combined effects of adult and larval movement on persistence and yield in a general, strategic framework. We describe how the capacity of a population to persist decreased with increasing home range size in a manner that depended on whether the sedentary case was maintained by self persistence or network persistence. Self persistence declined gradually with increasing home range and larval dispersal distance, while network persistence decreased sharply to 0 above a threshold home range and was less dependent on larval dispersal distance. The maximum home range size protected by a reserve network increased with the fraction of coastline in reserves and decreasing exploitation rates outside reserves. Spillover due to movement within a home range contributed to yield moderately under certain conditions, although yield contributions were generally not as large as those from spillover due to larval dispersal. Our results indicate that, for species exhibiting home range behavior, persistence in a network of marine reserves may be more predictable than previously anticipated from models based solely on larval dispersal, in part due to better knowledge of home range sizes. Including movement within a home range can change persistence results significantly from those assuming that adults are sedentary; hence it is an important consideration in reserve design. © 2009 by the Ecological Society of America.},

   abstract = {Reserves are being used increasingly to conserve fish communities and populations under threat from overfishing, but little consideration has been given to how fish behavior might affect reserve function. This review examines the implications of how fish use space, in particular the occurrence and size of home ranges and the frequency and direction of home range relocations. Examples are drawn primarily from the literature on coral reef fishes, but the principles apply to other habitats. Reserves can protect fish species only if individuals restrict their movements to a localized home range during at least part of the life cycle. Home range sizes increase with body size. In small reserves, a significant proportion of fish whose home ranges are centered within the reserve can be exposed to fishing mortality because their home ranges include non-reserve areas. Relocation of home ranges following initial settlement increases exposure to the fishery, especially if habitat selection is frequency-dependent. Distance, barriers, and costs of movement counter such redistribution. These considerations lead to predictions that population density and mean fish size (1) will form gradients across reserve boundaries with maxima in the center of the reserve and minima outside the reserve away from the boundary; (2) will increase rapidly in newly established reserves, only later providing 'spillover' to adjacent fisheries as density-dependent emigration begins to take effect; and (3) will be higher in reserves that are larger and have higher area:edge ratios, more habitat types, natural barriers between reserve and non-reserve areas, and higher habitat quality inside than outside the reserve. (4) Species with low mobility and weak density-dependence of space use will show the greatest increase in reserves and the strongest benefit for population reproductive capacity, but those with intermediate levels of these traits will provide the greatest spillover benefit to nearby fisheries.},

We present a case study as an example of a reserve design based on fine-scale habitats, the affinities of exploited species to these habitats, adult mobility, and the physical forcing affecting the dynamics of the habitats. These factors and their interaction are integrated in an algorithm that determines the optimal size and location of a marine reserve for a set of 20 exploited species within five different habitats inside a large kelp forest in southern California. The result is a reserve that encompasses ∼42% of the kelp forest. Our approach differs fundamentally from many other marine reserve siting methods in which goals of area, diversity, or biomass are targeted a priori. Rather, our method was developed to determine how large a reserve must be within a specific area to protect a self-sustaining assemblage of exploited species. The algorithm is applicable across different ecosystems, spatial scales, and for any number of species. The result is a reserve in which habitat value is optimized for a predetermined set of exploited species against the area left open to exploitation. The importance of fine-scale habitat definitions for the exploited species off La Jolla is exemplified by the spatial pattern of habitats and the stability of these habitats within the kelp forest, both of which appear to be determined by ocean microclimate. © 2006 by the Ecological Society of America.},

This study aims to evaluate the knowledge of practitioners of snook fishing - recreational anglers and commercial fishers, in addition to fishing guides, about snooks Centropomus spp and its habitat. Semi-structured interviews were applied and results were analyzed using WebQDA and R statistical softwares to evaluate the prevalence of responses and multiple correlations. The interviewees were able to morphologically differentiate snook species and describe aspects of food behavior, habitat, migration and reproduction. Part of this knowledge was similar to what is reported in the scientific literature. LEK was evident in commercial fishers and fishing guides when compared to recreational anglers probably due to more extensive experience in the fishing activity. Through the interviewees’ discourse, future scientific research demands were identified, such as understanding the factors that influence the growth of both species, migration between marine and brackish environments and the area of reproduction. This study demonstrated the advantages of using LEK to improve and promote adequate fisheries management.},

   abstract = {Objective: Communities are important settings for health promotion and prevention. The community readiness assessment offers a structured approach to assess resources and opportunities to tackle a health problem within a community. The assessment relies on semi-structured interviews with key informants from the communities. A number of 4–6 key informant interviews are recommended in the literature. However, it is unclear whether this is sufficient to obtain a valid representation of the respective community. This study analysed whether increasing the number of key informants from 4–6 to 12–15 alters the results of the community readiness assessment. Results: A total of 55 community readiness interviews were carried out in 4 communities. Overall, the community readiness scores showed little variation after having interviewed 10 key informants in a community. However, even after completing 10 interviews in a community, key informants were still able to identify up to 6 new information items regarding community efforts for physical activity promotion among the elderly, contact and communication channel for informing or approaching the target group, or barriers to participation.},

   abstract = {For species of conservation concern, an essential part of the recovery planning process is identifying discrete population units and their location with respect to one another. A common feature among geographically proximate populations is that the number of organisms tends to covary through time as a consequence of similar responses to exogenous influences. In turn, high covariation among populations can threaten the persistence of the larger metapopulation. Historically, explorations of the covariance in population size of species with many (>10) time series have been computationally difficult. Here, we illustrate how dynamic factor analysis (DFA) can be used to characterize diversity among time series of population abundances and the degree to which all populations can be represented by a few common signals. Our application focuses on anadromous Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha), a species listed under the US Endangered Species Act, that is impacted by a variety of natural and anthropogenic factors. Specifically, we fit DFA models to 24 time series of population abundance and used model selection to identify the minimum number of latent variables that explained the most temporal variation after accounting for the effects of environmental covariates. We found support for grouping the time series according to 5 common latent variables. The top model included two covariates: the Pacific Decadal Oscillation in spring and summer. The assignment of populations to the latent variables matched the currently established population structure at a broad spatial scale. At a finer scale, there was more population grouping complexity. Some relatively distant populations were grouped together, and some relatively close populations - considered to be more aligned with each other - were more associated with populations further away. These coarse- and fine-grained examinations of spatial structure are important because they reveal different structural patterns not evident in other analyses. Considerable interest and recent attention have been paid to the importance of intraspecies diversity and the ability of species to be resilient to perturbations much as diverse financial investment portfolios do. However, there is not as much attention paid to the mechanisms behind this. In our manuscript, we attempt to characterize intraspecies diversity through the analysis of empirical data sets of population abundance from a temporal and spatial perspective. We employ and illustrate an application of state-space modeling, dynamic factor analysis, which is gaining some attention in the ecological literature.},

The assessment indicates that coupled biophysical models are currently capable of simulating transport patterns, along with temperature and prey fields within marine ecosystems; they therefore provide insight into the variability of early-life-stage dynamics and connectivity within stocks. Moreover, the influence of environmental variability on potential recruitment success may be discerned from model hindcasts. Based on case studies, biophysical modelling results are shown to be capable of shedding light on whether stock management frameworks need re-evaluation. Hence, key modelling products were identified that will contribute to the development of viable stock recovery plans and management strategies.

Sixty-nine papers were reviewed to assess the contribution these models have made to recruitment prediction and understanding.

Most models used a Lagrangian tracking algorithm to advect and diffuse particles within the model domain. The vertical and horizontal resolutions and temporal durations of the models varied widely. This review identified 3 categories of papers: explanatory, inferential and hypothesis generating. Reviewed papers were dominated by explanatory approaches. Assessment of the sensitivity of model predictions to the model parameters were rare, but not entirely absent in this group of papers. Inferential approaches were the next most common, and sought to infer the presence or role of a particular mechanism. Hypothesis-generating publications were the rarest, but perhaps have the most to contribute to a greater understanding of recruitment processes. An increase in the frequency of hypothesis-generating applications of coupled physical-biological models may be expected over time as the field matures and refinements to both the physical and biological processes included in the models are made. © Inter-Research 2007.},

   abstract = {During the past century, the field of fisheries oceanography has dominated the study of population connectivity in marine environments. The influence of physical and biological processes and their relationship to transport and retention of early life history stages has been central in providing insight into population structuring and connectivity. However, the focus on dispersive early life history stages has meant that the role of adults has received less attention and is not fully understood or appreciated. We argue that adults play a vital role in population connectivity for a wide range of marine taxa and hypothesize that adult-mediated population connectivity commonly results in a diverse array of population structuring. Two case-studies on winter skate, Leucoraja ocellata, and winter flounder, Pseudopleuronectes americanus, are presented to illustrate the role adults play in marine connectivity at both broad and fine scales, respectively. Indeed, if adults are important for population connectivity, we argue that the role of larval processes is conditional on adult choice and only management and research pursuits that integrate the full life cycle of species will capture the full dynamics of metapopulation connectivity. Failure to include the roles of adults can lead to misinterpretation of the causes and consequences of changes in ecosystem structure and fisheries productivity. © 2013 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.},

To create ecological models with both expert and local people's knowledge, a multi-step fuzzy cognitive mapping approach is proposed. A cognitive map can be made of almost any system or problem. Cognitive maps are qualitative models of a system, consisting of variables and the causal relationships between those variables. We describe how our cognitive mapping research has been used in real environmental management applications. This research includes examining the perceptions of different stakeholders in an environmental conflict, obtaining the perceptions of different stakeholders to facilitate the development of participatory environmental management plans, and determining the wants and desires for resettlement of people displaced by a large scale dam project. Based on our research, which involved six separate studies, we have found that interviewees complete their cognitive maps in 40-90 min on average. These maps contain an average of 23±2 S.D. variables with 37±3 S.D. connections. People generally put more forcing functions into their maps than utility variables. Fuzzy cognitive mapping offers many advantages for ecological modeling including the ability to include abstract and aggregate variables in models, the ability to model relationships which are not known with certainty, the ability to model complex relationships which are full of feedback loops, and the ease and speed of obtaining and combining different knowledge sources and of running different policy options. © 2003 Elsevier B.V.

This review examines ontogeny of fishes with complex life histories, in particular how different phases can effect growth and the interpretation of growth models. Using the blackspot seabream (Pagellus bogaraveo) as an example, we explore alternative approaches to understanding growth in a species that undergoes both sex reallocation and ontogenetic vertical migration. More flexible models are required in order to accurately represent significant lifetime events, specifically accounting for periodical changes in the growth trajectory. Finally, model evaluation and interpretation need to be adequate to the task, particularly when outcomes are used to support resource management, in order to address concerns regarding conservation, sustainability, and successful management in the long term.},

Furthermore, the persistence of strong year-classes can be used to track the success of regulations that contribute to the increased survival and escapement of fish into the adult population. Size and age structures of Red Drum Sciaenops ocellatus were documented within the Tampa Bay estuary, in southwest Florida, using haul seines and trammel nets (1989-2008), and in nearshore Gulf of Mexico waters using a commercial purse seine (2005-2008). In the estuary, juvenile Red Drum (<100-mm TL) were collected from low-salinity backwater areas, and peaks in the annual relative abundance were apparent. In the estuary, Red Drum older than age 4 (>800-mm TL) were rare. Red Drum from nearshore gulf waters ranged from 2 to 35 years of age (674-1,074-mm TL), but most were greater than age 4. After back-calculating ages from Red Drum collected in the estuary and in nearshore gulf waters, we found that specific year-classes of Red Drum, driven by strong juvenile recruitment, were disproportionately represented in the adult spawning stock. We evaluated the long-term effectiveness of fishing regulations as a tool for rebuilding local adult Red Drum stocks by comparing data on size and age structures with results from earlier research conducted in the same geographic area. Adult Red Drum in nearshore waters off Tampa Bay were significantly longer, heavier, and older than were individuals collected a decade earlier, suggesting rebuilding of local Red Drum stocks. These observations validate the utility of long-term, multigear monitoring efforts to track populations from the estuary to nearshore coastal waters.Received June 27, 2013; accepted April 1, 2014. © 2014 © American Fisheries Society 2014.},

Despite this, they are often subdivided into separate populations, which are the basic units of fisheries management. For example, populations of some fisheries species across the deep water of the Timor Trench are genetically different, inferring minimal movement and interbreeding. When connectivity is higher than the Timor Trench example, but not so high that the populations become one, connectivity between populations is crinkled. Crinkled connectivity occurs when migration is above the threshold required to link populations genetically, but below the threshold for demographic links. In future, genetic estimates of connectivity over crinkled links could be uniquely combined with other data, such as estimates of population size and tagging and tracking data, to quantify demographic connectedness between these types of populations. Elasmobranch species may be ideal targets for this research because connectivity between populations is more likely to be crinkled than for finfish species. Fisheries stock-assessment models could be strengthened with estimates of connectivity to improve the strategic and sustainable harvesting of biological resources. © CSIRO 2013.},

Recent studies show that species distribution modelling can be a cost effective tool for describing fish habitat. However, few modelling studies have examined ontogenetic habitat associations. This is critical, as fish species often have different habitat preferences depending on their life stage. In this study, we used boosted regression trees (BRT) to describe ontogenetic habitat associations in snapper Pagrus auratus across the inner Hauraki Gulf of New Zealand. The BRT models identified that juvenile snapper were most frequently associated with slow orbital velocities and slow tidal current speeds, as well as biogenic sedimentary structures (area under the receiver operating curve or AUC, a measure of model performance, 0.79). In contrast, larger snapper were associated with faster tidal currents and faster orbital velocities (AUC 0.78). Juvenile and adult snapper were spatially separated; juvenile snapper occurred in waters close to shore, whereas large snapper occurred mainly in the channels between the islands and the waters around the islands. The successful discrimination of adult and juvenile habitat associations suggests that a modelling approach such as this could be useful for ecosystem-based management. © Inter-Research 2012.},

They also suffer some of the highest rates of degradation from human impacts of any ecosystems. Identifying and valuing nursery habitats is a critical part of their conservation, but current assessment practices typically take a static approach by considering habitats as individual and homogeneous entities. Here, we review current definitions of nursery habitat and propose a novel approach for assigning nursery areas for mobile fauna that incorporates critical ecological habitat linkages. We introduce the term 'seascape nurseries', which conceptualizes a nursery as a spatially explicit seascape consisting of multiple mosaics of habitat patches that are functionally connected. Hotspots of animal abundances/productivity identify the core area of a habitat mosaic, which is spatially constrained by the home ranges of its occupants. Migration pathways connecting such hotspots at larger spatial and temporal scales, through ontogenetic habitat shifts or inshore-offshore migrations, should be identified and incorporated. The proposed approach provides a realistic step forward in the identification and management of critical coastal areas, especially in situations where large habitat units or entire water bodies cannot be protected as a whole due to socio-economic, practical or other considerations.},

We hypothesized that juvenile fish residing in their nurseries increase their home range as they grow and eventually include coral reefs in their activity range before their permanent migration to this adult habitat. Tagged fish were detected by underwater receivers for a period up to 12 months and a clear diel pattern was visible with most detections occurring during nighttime. Bay-to-reef movements were undertaken by fish that were larger than fish that were only detected in the bay. Stable isotope values of fin tissue from fish that showed reef-ward movements were similar to those of fish remaining in the bay, indicating that these movements were likely exploratory behavior as opposed to repeated feeding excursions. Understanding cross-habitat ontogenetic movements is essential for identification of ecologically relevant spatial scales for management of coastal fish populations.},

   abstract = {An understanding of lifetime trophic changes and ontogenetic habitat shifts is essential to the preservation of marine fish species. We used carbon and nitrogen stable isotope values (?13C and ?15N) recorded within the laminar structure of fish eye lenses, reflecting both diet and location over time, to compare the lifetime trends of 2 demersal mesopredators. Tilefish Lophola-tilus chamaeleonticeps inhabit burrows on the outer continental shelf, which results in exceptional site fidelity. Red grouper Epinephelus morio are spawned on the middle to outer continental shelf, move to the inner shelf for the juvenile period, and return offshore upon sexual maturity. Both species inhabit the eastern Gulf of Mexico, a region with a distinctive offshore-inshore gradient in background ?13C values. Within individual tilefish (n = 36), sequences of ?13C values and ?15N values had strong, positive correlations with eye-lens diameter, and strong correlations be-tween the 2 isotopes (mean Spearman r = 0.86), reflecting an increase in trophic position with growth and little lifetime movement. In red grouper (n = 30), ?15N values positively correlated with eye-lens diameter, but correlations between ?15N and ?13C were weak (mean Spearman r = 0.29), suggesting cross-shelf ontogenetic movements. Linear mixed model results indicated strong relationships between ?15N and ?13C values in tilefish eye lenses but no convergence in the red grouper model. Collectively, these results are consistent with previously established differences in the life histories of the 2 species, demonstrating the potential utility of eye-lens isotope records, particularly for investigating the life histories of lesser-known species.},

   abstract = {Otolith stable carbon isotope ratios provide a unique and widely applicable environmental record. Unfortunately, uncertainty regarding the proportion of otolith carbon that derives from metabolized food versus dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) in the water currently limits utilization of this marker. We manipulated the δ 13C of food and ambient DIC in a factorial design with juvenile rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss). At the activity levels and total metabolic rates characteristic of fish in this study, 17% (±3% standard error, SE) of otolith C was metabolically derived, while >80% was derived from DIC in ambient water. We also estimated isotopic enrichment factors associated with physiological carbon transformations by measuring δ 13C of blood and endolymph (which closely tracked otolith δ 13C). There was substantial depletion in 13C of blood relative to C sources (ε blood-sources = -16.9‰ ± 1.1‰ SE), but substantial enrichment in 13C in otolith relative to blood (ε oto-blood = 13.3‰ ± 1.3‰ SE). Net isotopic enrichment between sources and the otolith was therefore slightly negative. Most of the isotopic enrichment between the blood and the otolith was associated with the movement of C from blood to endolymph, while enrichment associated with the precipitation of otolith aragonite from the endolymph was small. © 2005 NRC.},

The utility of otolith tracers (δ13C, δ18O, and Sr/Ca) as proxies for environmental salinity was tested for the estuarine-dependent juvenile white perch Morone americana. Analysis of water samples revealed a positive relationship between the salinity gradient and δ18O, δ13C, and Sr/Ca values of water in the Patuxent River estuary. Similarly, analysis of otolith material from young-of-the-year white perch (2001, 2004, 2005) revealed a positive relationship between salinity and otolith δ13C, δ18O, and Sr/Ca values. In classifying fish to their known salinity habitat, δ18O and Sr/Ca were moderately accurate tracers (53 to 79 % and 75 % correct classification, respectively), and δ13C provided near complete discrimination between habitats (93 to 100 % correct classification). Further, δ13C exhibited the lowest inter-annual variability and the largest range of response across salinity habitats. Thus, across estuaries, it is expected that resolution and reliability of salinity histories of juvenile white perch will be improved through the application of stable isotopes as tracers of salinity history. © Inter-Research 2007.},

   abstract = {The relative amounts of the stable isotopes of carbon and oxygen in fish otoliths can be used to reveal the environmental history experienced by the fish. This requires that the relative amounts of the isotopes are deposited in equilibrium with the surrounding environment, or that the offset from this equilibrium is known and can be quantified. It is known that carbon isotopes in biogenic carbonates are a mixture of carbon from the seawater and metabolically derived carbon, but the effect of the somatic growth rate of the fish is still unclear. The possible effect of otolith growth rate and fractionation of both carbon and oxygen isotopes are also not established. We carried out a controlled laboratory experiment where we reared cod (Gadus morhua L.) larvae and early juveniles at two temperatures (6 and 10°C) and generated different growth rates within each temperature by manipulation of prey levels. The otoliths of the resulting fish were analysed for carbon and oxygen isotopes. We found no effect of otolith precipitation rate on fractionation of either carbon or oxygen isotopes. However, there was a depletion of 13C in the otoliths of fish with elevated metabolism. The proportion of metabolically derived carbon in the otoliths was estimated to be 28-32%. Our results suggest that measurements of oxygen isotopes in otoliths can be a reliable tool to estimate ambient temperature since the oxygen isotopes seem to be deposited in the otoliths independently of kinetic and metabolic effects. Fractionation of carbon isotopes in otoliths on the other hand can give valuable insight into metabolism and feeding pattern of fish. © 2003 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.},

In this study we adopted a blind-test protocol and applied stable isotope analyses in chum salmon otoliths. Two aragonite powder samples were taken from each otolith: one from the nucleus of otoliths; the other from the 2nd summer growth zones. Overall the δ13C values of chum salmon otoliths ranged from −10.9 to −4.0‰, whereas δ18O values of the same samples ranged from −6.4 to +1.9‰. Based on δ18O values at about −3.5‰ (the boundary line), two different spawning populations or stocks have been identified (p-value = 0.008). The Site-A samples were collected from the Amur River, while the Site-B samples were collected from the Tumen River. The Suifen River (Site-C) samples had some mixing with the Amur River chum salmon, but they were essentially classified into the Tumen River population. Comparison between our data and the previously reported sockeye salmon and chinook salmon data in North America indicated that the chum salmon in China are anadromous, and have the same life history from freshwater to marine as other populations over the world.},

   abstract = {Differential fractionation of stable isotopes of carbon during photosynthesis causes C4 plants and C3 plants to have distinct carbon-isotope signatures. In addition, marine C3 plants have stable-isotope ratios of carbon that are intermediate between C4 and terrestrial C3 plants. The direct incorporation of the carbon-isotope ratio (13C/12C) of plants into consumers' tissues makes this ratio useful in studies of animal ecology. The heavy isotope of nitrogen (15N) is preferentially incorporated into the tissues of the consumer from the diet, which results in a systematic enrichment in nitrogen-isotope ratio (15N/14N) with each trophic level. Consequently, stable isotopes of nitrogen have been used primarily to assess position in food chains. The literature pertaining to the use of stable isotopes of carbon and nitrogen in animal trophic ecology was reviewed. Data from 102 studies that reported stable-isotope ratios of carbon and (or) nitrogen of wild birds and (or) mammals were compiled and analyzed relative to diet, latitude, body size, and habitat moisture. These analyses supported the predicted relationships among trophic groups. Carbon-isotope ratios differed among species that relied on C3, C4, and marine food chains. Likewise, nitrogen-isotope ratios were enriched in terrestrial carnivorous mammals relative to terrestrial herbivorous mammals. Also, marine carnivores that ate vertebrates had nitrogen-isotope ratios that were enriched over the ratios of those that ate invertebrates. Data from the literature also indicated that (i) the carbon-isotope ratio of carnivore bone collagen was inversely related to latitude, which was likely the result of an inverse relationship between the proportion of carbon in the food chain that was fixed by C4 plants and latitude; (ii) seabirds and marine mammals from northern oceans had higher nitrogen-isotope ratios than those from southern oceans; (iii) the nitrogen-isotope ratios of terrestrial mammals that used xeric habitats were higher than the ratios of those that used mesic habitats, indicating that water stress can have important effects on the nitrogen-isotope ratio, (iv) there was no relationship between body mass and nitrogen-isotope ratio for either bone collagen or muscle of carnivores; and (v) there was linear covariation between stable-isotope ratios of carbon and nitrogen in marine food chains (but not in terrestrial C3 or C4 food chains), which is likely a product of increases in carbon-isotope ratio with trophic level in marine food chains. Differences in stable-isotope composition among trophic groups were detected despite variation attributable to geographic location, climate, and analytical techniques, indicating that these effects are large and pervasive. Consequently, as knowledge of the distribution of stable isotopes of carbon and nitrogen increases, they will probably become an increasingly important tool in the study of avian and mammalian trophic ecology.},

   abstract = {Mangroves and salt marshes are considered important habitats for a diversity of fishery and other species. One of the key presumed values of these systems is their role in fuelling aquatic food webs that support many fisheries species. The mangrove-salt marsh ecotone along the NE Atlantic coast of Florida provides a natural experiment to examine the relative importance of mangrove and marsh production in supporting aquatic food webs. Representative food web components comprising key functional groups were sampled across the ecotone to test the prediction that species or functional groups that rely on the dominant wetland producers should show large differences in carbon stable isotope values across sites that span C4-dominated Spartina marshes in the north to C3-dominated mangrove wetlands in the south. Source contributions were estimated for fishery species (blue crabs, penaeid shrimp), wetland specialists (cyprinodontiformes fishes, grass shrimp, fiddler crabs), zoobenthivores (pinfish, spot), phytodetritivores (mullet) and planktivores (menhaden, anchovy, silversides). The range of wetland macrophyte source contributions had minima < 5% for most groups at most sites, despite the shift from C3- to C4-dominated wetlands, suggesting that Spartina and mangroves contributed minimally to the trophic support of these groups. Spatial correlations between sources and individual consumer species that spanned the ecotone showed the strongest correlations with micro-algal sources (microphytobenthos/phytoplankton), weak correlations with a ‘wetland’ source reflecting the transition from Spartina to mangroves across the ecotone, and no correlation with either mangrove or Spartina sources. These findings suggest a limited role of mangrove or Spartina production in supporting the aquatic consumers examined.},

   abstract = {Vegetated salt marsh habitats are widely considered critical for supporting many species of nekton, yet direct evidence of the processes controlling marsh habitat use for most species remains elusive. We related salt marsh flooding patterns and nekton trophic dynamics among 14 sites spanning 2500 km across the northern Gulf of Mexico (GoM) and southern Atlantic coasts of the USA. Functional access for nekton to marsh vegetation (edge flooded to ≥5 cm depth) ranged from <40% of the time at some central GoM sites to >90% access in the western GoM and Pamlico Sound. Food web mixing models based on stable isotope analysis show that the importance of Spartina trophic support for common nekton may be regulated by the duration of marsh surface flooding. In particular, the potential contribution of Spartina production was positively related to indices of marsh surface flooding for brown shrimp Farfantepenaeus aztecus, white shrimp Litopenaeus setiferus, small (≤60 mm carapace width) blue crabs Callinectes sapidus, grass shrimp Palaemonetes pugio, and killifish Fundulus heteroclitus/grandis. The value of Spartina salt marsh production to several common species of nekton appears to depend, at least in part, on direct access to the vegetated marsh surface, which is regulated by hydrodynamics. Hence, the substantial geographic and temporal variability in marsh flooding regulates the functional roles and value of these tidal wetlands for aquatic organisms. © Inter-Research 2013.},

The available global mangrove databases, compiled using disparate geospatial data sources and national statistics, need to be improved. Here, we mapped the status and distributions of global mangroves using recently available Global Land Survey (GLS) data and the Landsat archive.Methods We interpreted approximately 1000 Landsat scenes using hybrid supervised and unsupervised digital image classification techniques. Each image was normalized for variation in solar angle and earth-sun distance by converting the digital number values to the top-of-the-atmosphere reflectance. Ground truth data and existing maps and databases were used to select training samples and also for iterative labelling. Results were validated using existing GIS data and the published literature to map 'true mangroves'.Results The total area of mangroves in the year 2000 was 137,760 km2 in 118 countries and territories in the tropical and subtropical regions of the world. Approximately 75% of world's mangroves are found in just 15 countries, and only 6.9% are protected under the existing protected areas network (IUCN I-IV). Our study confirms earlier findings that the biogeographic distribution of mangroves is generally confined to the tropical and subtropical regions and the largest percentage of mangroves is found between 5° N and 5° S latitude.Main conclusions We report that the remaining area of mangrove forest in the world is less than previously thought. Our estimate is 12.3% smaller than the most recent estimate by the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) of the United Nations. We present the most comprehensive, globally consistent and highest resolution (30 m) global mangrove database ever created.

The carbon dynamics in mangrove ecosystems has been the subject of numerous studies during the past decades, but we are still far from having an integrated view of the overall ecosystem functioning in terms of organic matter processing. The application of recent analytical techniques has produced a wealth of new information but has also indicated the gaps in our knowledge on organic matter cycling in these ecosystems. This paper provides an overview of our current understanding of organic matter dynamics in mangrove ecosystems, and reviews data based on stable isotope analyses, on (i) the delineation of carbon sources in different organic matter pools, (ii) utilization patterns of organic carbon by microbial and faunal communities, and (iii) organic matter exchange between mangroves and adjacent ecosystems. Although the use of stable isotopes has a number of limitations and has not always been able to unambiguously assess source contributions, it has been invaluable in refuting some long-standing paradwigms, and has shown that source characterization is crucial in order to better estimate organic matter budgets in these dynamic ecosystems. Future studies on process rates or flux measurements should therefore ideally be combined with a variety of chemical tracers to determine the source of the organic matter considered. © 2007 Elsevier B.V.

In addition, the proportions of the 2 sources in otolith daily increments were also determined by the diel variations in the rate of incorporation from the 2 sources. A group of fish was administered with D-[ 14C-U]-glucose or was exposed to water containing NaH 14CO 3, and incubated for 1, 3, 6, 12 and 24 h. Another group was similarly treated with the radiocarbons at 06:00, 12:00, 18:00, 00:00 or again at 06:00 h, and were incubated for 6 h. After incubation, serum and otoliths were collected and were separated into organic and inorganic carbon fractions, and the incorporation rates from the 2 sources were determined. The rates of carbon incorporation from D-[ 14C-U]-glucose injected and NaH 14CO 3 water were 0.27 (25.5%) and 0.79 (74.5%) nmol mg -1 otolith h -1, respectively. During darkness (18:00 to 06:00 h), both the incorporation rate and proportion of metabolic-CO 2-derived carbon significantly decreased to ~50% of that during daylight. These results suggest that otolith carbonate is mainly derived from ambient water, and the ratio of carbon derived from metabolic CO 2 is lower in the D-zone than that in the L-zone of the otolith daily increments. © Inter-Research 2008.},

We used a constrained dynamic factor analysis to explore patterns of covariance in productivity among 16 Fraser River sockeye salmon (Oncorhynchus nerka) conservation units (CUs). Specifically, we tested whether coherent trends in productivity covaried with five distinct ecological attributes: physical characteristics of nursery lakes, large-scale management interventions, genetic similarity, adult migration phenology, or juvenile migratory traits. The top-ranked model had two trends based on nursery lake characteristics and juvenile migratory traits. One trend represented the dynamics of CUs that rear in nursery lakes prior to ocean entry and undergo relatively rapid marine migrations. The second included a sea-type CU, Harrison River, which enters the marine environment without rearing in a nursery lake and migrates more slowly. The uniform response of lake-type CUs, as well as Harrison River CU’s unique life history, suggests that coherent trends are structured by traits that covary with broad life history type, rather than fine-scale characteristics. Furthermore, we document substantial temporal variability in the strength of synchronous dynamics among Fraser River CUs. Greater synchrony in recent years suggests that the importance of shared regional drivers, relative to local processes, may have increased.},

   abstract = {The spatial scales at which the dynamics of subpopulations are synchronized affect regional population persistence and reflect the operational spatial scales of factors regulating populations. I examined phase synchrony in the fluctuations of age-0 winter flounder (Pseudopleuronectes americanus) production among 19 southern New England (SNE), USA, coastal nurseries. From 1990 to 2004, nursery production was synchronized at scales up to ∼200 km based on spatial trends in cross-correlations of first-differenced age-0 abundance time series. However, sliding window analysis of 1975-2005 time series collected in six nurseries ≤55 km apart in northern SNE indicated that synchrony increased from low to high values in the early 1990s. Synchrony in production also increased among three nurseries ≤65 km apart in southern SNE from 1984 to 2004. Thus, interannual fluctuations in nursery production appeared to become synchronized at coarser spatial scales throughout SNE during the 1990s. This coarsening of the spatial scale of control of winter flounder nursery production was coincident with an increase in the frequency of springs with warm temperatures believed to negatively affect early life history processes. Spatial synchronization of winter flounder nursery ground production could destabilize the age-class structure and population dynamics in the region. © 2008 NRC.},

   abstract = {The world is spatially autocorrelated. Both abiotic and biotic properties are more similar among neighboring than distant locations, and their temporal co-fluctuations also decrease with distance. P. A. P. Moran realized the ecological importance of such ‘spatial synchrony’ when he predicted that isolated populations subject to identical log-linear density-dependent processes should have the same correlation in fluctuations of abundance as the correlation in environmental noise. The contribution from correlated weather to synchrony of populations has later been coined the ‘Moran effect’. Here, we investigate the potential role of the Moran effect in large-scale ecological outcomes of global warming. Although difficult to disentangle from dispersal and species interaction effects, there is compelling evidence from across taxa and ecosystems that spatial environmental synchrony causes population synchrony. Given this, and the accelerating number of studies reporting climate change effects on local population dynamics, surprisingly little attention has been paid to the implications of global warming for spatial population synchrony. However, a handful of studies of insects, birds, plants, mammals and marine plankton indicate decadal-scale changes in population synchrony due to trends in environmental synchrony. We combine a literature review with modeling to outline potential pathways for how global warming, through changes in the mean, variability and spatial autocorrelation of weather, can impact population synchrony over time. This is particularly likely under a ‘generalized Moran effect’, i.e. when relaxing Moran's strict assumption of identical log-linear density-dependence, which is highly unrealistic in the wild. Furthermore, climate change can influence spatial population synchrony indirectly, through its effects on dispersal and species interactions. Because changes in population synchrony may cascade through food-webs, we argue that the (generalized) Moran effect is key to understanding and predicting impacts of global warming on large-scale ecological dynamics, with implications for extinctions, conservation and management.},

Marine ecosystems in the North Pacific support productive fisheries and diverse ecosystem services, and they are subject to large-scale environmental, human, and ecological perturbations. Ichthyoplankton time-series from these ecosystems may provide an important indicator of lower trophic level dynamics and ecosystem functioning. Here we present a spatiotemporal analysis using data from three decades of ichthyoplankton surveys in the Gulf of Alaska to investigate temporal patterns in indicators of species richness, Shannon diversity, and synchrony. Then we use Dynamic Factor Analysis (DFA) to synthesize the ichthyoplankton assemblage with two dominant trends. We relate the biodiversity indices and DFA trends to local and regional climate indices in the North Pacific. We find evidence for increased temperatures driving increased species richness, and changes in synchrony coincident with shifting assemblage composition and the 1988/1989 regime shift. Shannon diversity was largely driven by the dominance of larval walleye pollock (Gadus chalcogrammus). Correlations between climate drivers and DFA trends suggest that the influence of basin scale drivers (North Pacific Gyre Oscillation and the Pacific Decadal Oscillation) were stronger than the influence of local-scale drivers like regional sea surface temperature. Our work demonstrates the potential value of ichthyoplankton surveys to provide indicators of climate-driven ecosystem variability and long-term ecological change.},

In Lake Michigan, we evaluated whether climatic or other physical variables could also induce spatial synchrony across multiple species, including bloater (Coregonus hoyi), rainbow smelt (Osmerus mordax), yellow perch (Perca flavescens), and alewife (Alosa pseudoharengus). The residuals from stock–recruitment relationships revealed yellow perch recruitment to be correlated with recruitment of both rainbow smelt (r = 0.37) and alewife (r = 0.36). Across all four species, higher than expected recruitment occurred in 5 years between 1978 and 1987 and then switched to lower than expected recruitment in 5 years between 1996 and 2004. Generalized additive models revealed warmer spring and summer water temperatures and lower wind speeds corresponded to higher than expected recruitment for the nearshore-spawning species, and overall variance explained ranged from 14% (yellow perch) to 61% (alewife). For all species but rainbow smelt, higher recruitment also occurred in extremely high or low years of the North Atlantic Oscillation index. Future development of indices that describe the physical Great Lakes environment could improve understanding of how climate can synchronize fish populations within and across species.},

   abstract = {Historical time-series of recruitment to plaice stocks around the United Kingdom were examined for evidence of synchrony. Correlations were significant for most pair-wise comparisons and a meta-analysis test over all the stocks was highly significant. Previous studies on plaice recruitment in the North Sea have suggested that a negative relationship exists between sea temperature, during the first few months of the year, and subsequent year-class strength. When we examined the correlations between sea surface temperature and plaice recruitment, we found statistically significant negative relationships for most areas. These were strongest for the period February-June. Our results are consistent with the hypothesis that the temperature effect on recruitment of North Sea plaice is due to changes in predation pressure on the planktonic stages. However, western (North Sea and Channel) and eastern (Irish Sea and Celtic Sea) stocks appeared to respond to different time-scales of temperature variability which may imply that different mechanisms could be operating in these stocks. Management of plaice is based upon projections of future stock dynamics. Compared with fisheries on some other species, those on plaice are less dependent on the in-coming year-class. Therefore, the incorporation of sea temperature data into plaice stock dynamic models will probably not have a large impact on short-term projections. However, incorporation of a temperature relationship will allow medium to long-term forecasts to be made under varying environmental scenarios. These may provide a more realistic range of projections of future stock trends than is currently achieved. Crown Copyright © 2000 Published by Elsevier Science B.V.},

Alongside traditional viability metrics (i.e., the number of populations, their spatial extent, the status of each population), consideration of spatial synchrony in these assessments may provide additional insight into extinction risk as well as the relative importance of intrinsic and extrinsic factors on population dynamics. We demonstrate a method for estimating abundance trends in populations of the endangered freshwater fish, the amber darter (Percina antesella), while simultaneously assessing empirical support for existence of spatial synchrony among its two populations in the Conasauga and Etowah rivers in Georgia, U.S.A. Our analysis was performed using multivariate autoregressive state-space (MARSS) models with annual sampling data from 1996 to 2018 at 16 sites distributed between the two rivers. Our results indicate that amber darter populations have declined substantially, with 9% annual losses in both the Conasauga and Etowah rivers, suggesting rangewide imperilment. Furthermore, model selection indicated little support for models with fully independent dynamics between rivers, which may compound overall extinction risk. This analysis demonstrates the utility of tools such as MARSS models for assessing spatial synchrony and long-term population trajectories of imperiled species, resulting in improved vulnerability assessments that do not assume independence among separate populations.},

However, spatially explicit and temporally resolved data sets can be difficult to analyze using classical statistical methods because the data are typically autocorrelated and thus violate the assumption of independence. Here, we describe the synchrony package for the R programming environment, which provides modern parametric and nonparametric methods for (i) quantifying temporal and spatial patterns of auto- and cross-correlated variability in univariate, bivariate, and multivariate data sets, and (ii) assessing their statistical significance via Monte Carlo randomizations. We illustrate how the methods included in the package can be used to investigate the causes of spatial and temporal variability in ecological systems through a series of examples, and discuss the assumptions and caveats of each statistical procedure in order to provide a practical guide for their application in the real world. © 2014 British Ecological Society.},

This phenomenon has been documented in the dynamics of species representing a variety of taxa and ecological roles. Synchrony may arise from three primary mechanisms: (a) dispersal among populations, reducing the size of relatively large populations and increasing relatively small ones; (b) congruent dependence of population dynamics on a synchronous exogenous random factor such as temperature or rainfall, a phenomenon known as the "Moran effect"; and (c) trophic interactions with populations of other species that are themselves spatially synchronous or mobile. Identification of the causes of synchrony is often difficult. In addition to intraspecific synchrony, there are many examples of synchrony among populations of different species, the causes of which are similarly complex and difficult to identify. Furthermore, some populations may exhibit complex spatial dynamics such as spiral waves and chaos. Statistical tests based on phase coherence and/or time-lagged spatial correlation are required to characterize these more complex patterns of spatial dynamics fully.},

By synthesising and extending prior work, we show how geography of synchrony, a term which we use to refer to detailed spatial variation in patterns of synchrony, can be leveraged to understand ecological processes including identification of drivers of synchrony, a long-standing challenge. We focus on three main objectives: (1) showing conceptually and theoretically four mechanisms that can generate geographies of synchrony; (2) documenting complex and pronounced geographies of synchrony in two important study systems; and (3) demonstrating a variety of methods capable of revealing the geography of synchrony and, through it, underlying organism ecology. For example, we introduce a new type of network, the synchrony network, the structure of which provides ecological insight. By documenting the importance of geographies of synchrony, advancing conceptual frameworks, and demonstrating powerful methods, we aim to help elevate the geography of synchrony into a mainstream area of study and application.},

Although much research exists on recreational fishers and their actions, this research is often disconnected from management issues. One way to help to overcome this disconnect is to illustrate how past research on the social component of recreational fishing fits within an emerging coupled social-ecological system (SES) framework. Herein, a conceptual SES is first developed with specific attention to recreational fisheries. This SES is then used to illustrate the importance of considering human dimensions research for articulating, studying and ultimately managing key outcomes of recreational fisheries (e.g. fish population conservation, fisher well-being) using the example of harvest regulations and a brief review of past interdisciplinary research on recreational fishing. The article ends by identifying key research needs including understanding: how factors such as management rules affect the diversity of actions by recreational fishers; how governance and management approaches adapt to changing social and resource conditions; and how recreational fishers learn and share information. © 2013 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.},

   abstract = {Marine conservation areas require high levels of compliance to meet conservation objectives, yet little research has assessed compliance quantitatively, especially for recreational fishers. Recreational fishers take 12% of global annual fish catches. With millions of people fishing from small boats, this fishing sector is hard to monitor, making accurate quantification of non-compliance an urgent research priority. Shore-based remote camera monitoring was tested for quantifying recreational non-compliance in near-shore, coastal rockfish conservation areas (RCAs) in the Salish Sea, Canada. Six high definition trail cameras were used to monitor 42 locations between July and August 2014. Seventy-nine percent of monitored conservation area sites showed confirmed or probable fishing activity, with no significant difference in fishing effort inside and outside RCAs. Mixed effects generalized linear models were used to test environmental and geographic factors influencing compliance. Sites with greater depth had significantly higher fishing effort, which may imply high, barotrauma-induced, rockfish mortality in RCA sites. Non-compliance estimates were similar to aerial fly-over compliance data from 2011, suggesting that trail camera monitoring may be an accurate and affordable alternative method of assessing non-compliance in coastal conservation areas, especially for community-based organizations wishing to monitor local waters. Widespread non-compliance could compromise the ability of RCAs to protect and rebuild rockfish populations. Increased education, signage, and enforcement is likely to improve compliance.},

   abstract = {Among the critical issues for the management of estuarine fish resources is the need to adequately identify the extent of use by recreational fishers, and the allocation of the resource between recreational and commercial users. Recreational anglers in estuaries often target a similar range of estuarine fish species to commercial fishers. Prior to the declaration of 'recreational fishing havens' (estuarine waters closed to commercial netting but remaining open to recreational angling) in many New South Wales (NSW) estuaries in May 2002, the estuary of the Manning River on the central NSW coast supported the tenth most productive commercial estuarine net fishery in the State. To quantify the recreational angling effort in the Manning River estuary, progressive counts were made of shore-based and boat-based anglers from a small power boat from June 2001 to May 2002. Sample days (eight per month) were chosen in a stratified random fashion, taking into account the proportions of weekends, public holidays and school holidays in each month. The total recreational angling effort exerted on the estuary for the 12-month period was 144 892 ± 3248 angler-hours, indicating a low to medium effort compared to other NSW estuaries of similar size. Over half of the effort was exerted in the section nearest the northern entrance at Harrington. There was relatively little variation in shore-based angling effort throughout the year, whereas boat-based fishing increased markedly in summer. Months that coincided with NSW school holidays were most popular, especially January. More recreational fishing effort was exerted in the afternoons than in the mornings during winter, but this trend was reversed in summer. Although daily effort was much higher on weekends than weekdays, the total cumulative effort was generally similar, due to the greater number of weekdays in the year. Pilot studies of catch per unit effort indicate that the recreational catch in the Manning River estuary is probably small compared to the pre-closure commercial catch. Therefore management strategies aimed at limiting the recreational catch are likely to have minimal impact on fish stocks in the estuary when compared with regulation of the commercial sector. © 2006 Institute of Australian Geographers.},

   abstract = {We describe a cost effective method of continuously monitoring relative trends in recreational effort and harvest, based on web camera imagery and interview data provided by a concurrent low intensity creel survey. The number of boats returning to three boat ramps in separate regions on the north eastern coast of New Zealand's North Island fluctuated over a ten year period between 2004–05 and 2013–14. The most pronounced change occurred in the Hauraki Gulf, where most recreational fishing occurs. Web camera monitoring detected a 34% decline in the number of boats returning to one of the busiest ramps in the Hauraki Gulf over a three year period between 2011–12 and 2013–14, which was mirrored by a 58% decline in snapper catch rates over the same period. The combined result was a 71% decline in the weight of snapper landed annually at the monitored ramp over this three year period, which was far more rapid than anticipated given differences seen between harvest estimates provided by infrequent large scale surveys in the past. Trends in effort and harvest derived from data collected at a small number of ramps will only have utility, however, if they reflect trends in the wider fishery. The relative difference in snapper harvest estimates provided by aerial-access surveys of the entire Hauraki Gulf fishery in 2004–05 and 2011–12, closely matched the difference in the harvest landed at the high traffic ramp that was monitored in the Gulf during these years. This independent confirmation of relative trends inferred from combined web camera and creel survey monitoring at a small number of sites has further highlighted the need to continuously monitor recreational fisheries, which are potentially far more dynamic than previously thought. We discuss strategies that we have progressively developed to minimise the cost of monitoring these recreational fisheries and how they could be applied to continuously monitor recreational fisheries elsewhere.},

   abstract = {Digital time-lapse cameras (cameras) are increasingly used for monitoring recreational angling effort on water bodies such as lakes and rivers. Cameras are an attractive alternative to traditional methods for monitoring angling effort such as aerial counts and on-water creel surveys because of their relatively low running costs. However, cameras take photographs intermittently and it is not possible for the camera field of view to cover the entire water body in most applications. It is therefore necessary to bias correct (uprate) the camera observations of angling effort to obtain estimates of total angling effort including those out of the camera field of view. We developed a hierarchical Bayesian model to predict total angling effort from camera observations of angling effort. The model was fitted to creel effort survey data and then used to impute ('fill-in') total angling effort data for a larger dataset of camera observations where there were no creel survey data. The model accounted for three issues encountered when uprating camera observations of angling effort to total angling effort: (1) camera observations of zero angler effort when anglers were outside the field-of-view; (2) incomplete creel survey data; and (3) occasional data gaps caused by equipment malfunction. We applied the model to camera data from a number of small lakes in British Columbia, Canada using it to predict total angling effort that accounts for observation error. We explore the various model assumptions and discuss the limitations of the approach.},

   abstract = {Recreational fishing in the United States is an important social and economic component of many marine fisheries, with an estimated 14 million anglers making almost 82 million fishing trips in 2004. Although each individual angler typically harvests a small number of fish, collectively these sport fisheries can take a significant fraction of the yearly catch--in some cases more than commercial fisheries. For example, in 1999, recreational fishing accounted for 94% of the total catch of spotted sea trout, 76% of striped bass and sheephead, and 60 percent of king mackerel. It is important that systems used to monitor fishing catch are adequate for timely management of recreational fisheries. However, the large number of anglers and access points makes monitoring recreational fishing much more difficult than monitoring commercial fishing. This report reviews the types of survey methods used to estimate catch in recreational fisheries, including state/federal cooperative programs. The report finds that both telephone survey and onsite access components of the current monitoring systems have serious flaws in design or implementation. There are also several areas of miscommunication and mismatched criteria among designers of surveys, data collectors, and recreational fisheries. The report recommends that a comprehensive, universal sampling frame with national coverage should be established, and that improvements should be made in statistical analysis of the data collected and in the ways the data are communicated. A permanent and independent research group should be established and funded to evaluate the statistical design and adequacy of recreational fishery surveys and to guide necessary modifications or new initiatives.},

   abstract = {Marine recreational fishing (MRF) has been shown to substantially contribute to fishing mortality of marine fish. However, European MRF catches are only quantified for a small number of stocks, so it is unclear whether a significant part of fishing mortality is excluded from stock assessments. This study estimated: (i) European MRF removals, which were defined as landings plus dead releases; and (ii) impact at stock level by comparing the percentage contribution to total removal by MRF and commercial fishing. As MRF data were limited for some European countries, catches were reconstructed using a mixture of average release proportions, average fish weights, and extrapolation using the catch per fisher of the nearest country providing catch estimates. Where catch reconstructions exceeded 50%, data were excluded from further analysis. Furthermore, as MRF survey methodology can be variable, semi-quantitative estimates of bias and error were calculated for each stock. Only 10 of the 20 stocks assessed in this study had sufficient MRF data for full reliable estimates. Percentage contribution to total removals (MRF + commercial removals) by MRF ranged between 2% for Atlantic mackerel in the North Sea and Skagerrak and 43% for Atlantic pollack in the Celtic Seas and English Channel. The biomass removed ranged between 297 (± 116) tonnes (Atlantic cod in the western English Channel and southern Celtic seas) and 4820 (± 1889) tonnes (Atlantic mackerel in the North Sea and Skagerrak), but the errors were substantial. Additionally, the bias in the estimated removals was low for most stocks, with some positive biases found. The present study indicates that removals by MRF can represent a high proportion of the total removals for some European marine fish stocks, so inclusion in stock assessments should be routine. To achieve this, regular surveys of MRF are required to collect data essential for stock assessments.},

   abstract = {Information on shore-based recreational fishing is essential for the sustainable management of nearshore fish stocks. However, obtaining estimates of catch and effort from such fishing activity can be complex and expensive due to the large spatial scales over which surveys are typically conducted and the fine-scale temporal resolution that is desired. Complementary surveys are one option for improving the accuracy of estimates. A pilot study was conducted in Perth, Western Australia, from April to June 2010 to test an expanded aerial-roving survey design that incorporated remotely operated cameras. Cameras recorded the distribution of shore-based fishing activity across a 24-h day, highlighting an afternoon peak as well as some nighttime activity, which is rarely captured in existing survey designs. This information was combined with instantaneous counts of shore fishers from aerial surveys and trip length data that were obtained from 1,194 incomplete trip interviews conducted during roving creel surveys; the resulting estimate of fishing effort was 213,460 angler-hours (SE = 18,141; relative SE [RSE] = 8%). Catch rates, which were calculated from roving creel survey data on the numbers of retained fish, were combined with fishing effort to estimate a total retained catch of 355,801 fish (SE = 41,446; RSE = 12%). The Australian herring Arripis georgianus was the dominant species, with a retained catch of 229,779 fish (SE = 39,007; RSE = 17%). In comparison with other on-site techniques, the incorporation of cameras into an aerial-roving survey design provides a generic, cost-effective method for measuring the distribution of shore-based fishing activity across a 24-h day. Our findings improve the understanding of the exploitation of nearshore fish stocks along the Perth coast. Our method has broad application to many other recreational fisheries around the world, especially where nighttime fishing is popular. © American Fisheries Society 2012.},

   abstract = {Enhancing our understanding of fish dispersal is central to the success of modern-day conservation efforts in freshwater ecosystems. However, methods seeking to estimate dispersal are diverse; ranging from direct estimation of individual movements, computation of dispersal kernels, to indirect assessment using measures of gene flow across riverscapes. An important question is whether results from these different approaches provide a consistent picture of the spatial scales of dispersal. Here, we performed a review and meta-analysis of the literature reporting both individual movements and genetic data to characterize patterns of dispersal for riverine fishes globally. Across all the studies considered (Ndirect = 206; Nindirect = 205), our results suggest restricted magnitudes of dispersal for riverine fishes, but highlight a large heterogeneity among species, taxonomic orders and geographies. For instance, we found that the maximum parent–offspring dispersal distances varied from 69 m to 1,086 km (median = 12 km; Nspecies = 107), whereas the dispersal spread derived from isolation-by-distance slopes (σIBD) from genetic data ranged from 19 m to 250 km (median = 1 km; Nspecies = 56). Comparisons of species-specific values also revealed significant and positive relationships between direct and indirect estimates of dispersal distances, indicating that organismal movement ability often translates into effective transmission of genes. Finally, this global overview pointed to important geographic and taxonomic disparities in the study of dispersal for riverine fishes. We thus encourage researchers to broaden the taxonomic and geographical scope of future investigations and identify emerging research frontiers where new scientific efforts are needed.},

   abstract = {Pulse subsidies account for a substantial proportion of resource availability in many systems, having persistent and cascading effects on consumer population dynamics, and energy flow within and across ecosystem boundaries. Although the importance of pulsed resource subsidies is well-established, the mechanisms that regulate resource fluxes across ecosystem boundaries are not well understood. The aim of our study was to determine the extent that marsh consumers regulated a marsh prey subsidy to estuarine consumers in the oligohaline reaches of an Everglades estuary. We characterized a marsh pulsed subsidy of cyprinodontoid, invertebrate and sunfish prey that move into the upper estuary from adjacent drying marshes. In response to the prey pulse, we examined the numerical, fitness and dietary responses of three focal consumers in the upper estuary; two marsh species (largemouth bass and bowfin) that accompanied the subsidy as a result of marsh drying, and one estuarine consumer (snook). At the onset of marsh drying and the prey subsidy, estuarine consumers switched diets to consume the larger marsh prey (sunfishes), while bass and bowfin maintained similar diets (cyprinodontoids and invertebrates respectively) than pre and post subsidy. From the consumption of this subsidy, bass (marsh species) and snook (estuarine species) exhibited fitness gains while bowfin did not. Although both marsh and estuarine consumers benefitted from the subsidy, we found evidence that freshwater consumers shunted some of the subsidy away from snook. Of the prey sampled in consumer stomachs, 41% of marsh prey biomass was eaten by marsh consumers, while 59% was consumed by the estuarine consumer. We conclude that the amount of the marsh prey available to estuarine consumers may be greater in the absence of marsh consumers, thus the magnitude of the prey subsidy could depend on the dynamics of the marsh consumers from donor communities. © 2013 The Authors.},

   abstract = {A total of 1784 legal-size (≥356 mm TL) hatchery-produced red drum (Sciaenops ocellatus) were tagged and released to estimate tag-reporting levels of recreational anglers in South Carolina (SC) and Georgia (GA). Twelve groups of legal-size fish (∼150 fish/ group) were released. Half of the fish of each group were tagged with an external tag with the message "reward" and the other half of the fish were implanted with tags with the message "$100 reward." These fish were released into two estuaries in each state (n=4); three replicate groups were released at different sites within each estuary (n=12). From results obtained in previous tag return experiments conducted by wildlife and fisheries biologists, it was hypothesized that reporting would be maximized at a reward level of $100/tag. Reporting level for the "reward" tags was estimated by dividing the number of "reward" tags returned by the number of "$100 reward" tags returned. The cumulative return level for both tag messages was 22.7 (±1.9)% in SC and 25.8 (±4.1)% in GA. These return levels were typical of those recorded by other red drum tagging programs in the region. Return data were partitioned according to verbal survey information obtained from anglers who reported tagged fish. Based on this partitioned data set, 14.3 (±2.1)% of "reward" tags were returned in SC, and 25.5 (±2.3)% of "$100 reward" tags were returned. This finding indicates that only 56.7% of the fish captured with "reward" tags were reported in SC. The pattern was similar for GA where 19.1 (±10.6)% of "reward" message tags were returned as compared with 30.1 (±15.6)% for "$100 reward" message tags. This difference yielded a reporting level of 63% for "reward" tags in GA. Currently, 50% is used as the estimate for the angler reporting level in population models for red drum and a number of other coastal finfish species in the South Atlantic region of the United States. Based on results of our study, the commonly used reporting estimate may result in an overestimate of angler exploitation for red drum.},

   abstract = {In response to repeated complaints from recreational and commercial coastal fishermen about declining fishing opportunities in inner Danish waters, focus was directed to inshore fish stocks. However, without data targeting inshore areas, it was not possible to investigate potential changes in fish distribution or abundances, or their causes. As a first step, a voluntary catch registration system was initiated in 2002, in collaboration with locally organized recreational fishermen. Using citizen science as a methodology, scientists and the fishermen developed a protocol for data collection, which the fishermen then implemented. The aim was to establish regular monitoring of fish catches from gill net and fyke net fisheries in coastal waters around Denmark in order to provide data that could inform management. After three years, during which time recreational fishermen could use their own gear and fish where they normally fished, the data was evaluated. As a result, the fishing method was switched in 2005 to fixed gears and fixed positions, to enable comparison between areas, years and season. The project has been very successful in recruiting highly motivated fishermen, who register their entire catch regularly. The time-series of data spans more than a decade and covers over 16,000 instances of fishing. The data from this project are now being used to create coastal fish indicators for managers to assess environmental status at a regional scale. Here we present an analysis of a subset of the data on one species, the European flounder (Platichthys flesus), to illustrate how the spatial and seasonal coverage can be utilized further for investigation of coastal ecosystems and to inform management.},

   abstract = {The connectivity between the fish community of estuarine mangroves and that of freshwater habitats upstream remains poorly understood. In the Florida Everglades, mangrove-lined creeks link freshwater marshes to estuarine habitats downstream and may act as dry-season refuges for freshwater fishes. We examined seasonal dynamics in the fish community of ecotonal creeks in the southwestern region of Everglades National Park, specifically Rookery Branch and the North and Watson rivers. Twelve low-order creeks were sampled via electrofishing, gill nets, and minnow traps during the wet season, transition period, and dry season in 2004-2005. Catches were greater in Rookery Branch than in the North and Watson rivers, particularly during the transition period. Community composition varied seasonally in Rookery Branch, and to a greater extent for the larger species, reflecting a pulse of freshwater taxa into creeks as marshes upstream dried periodically. The pulse was short-lived, a later sample showed substantial decreases in freshwater fish numbers. No evidence of a similar influx was seen in the North and Watson rivers, which drain shorter hydroperiod marshes and exhibit higher salinities. These results suggest that head-water creeks can serve as important dry-season refugia. Increased freshwater flow resulting from Everglades restoration may enhance this connectivity. © 2007 Rosenstiel School of Marine and Atmospheric Science of the University of Miami.},

   abstract = {Citizen science is a rapidly growing field with well-designed and run citizen science projects providing substantial benefits for conservation and management. Marine citizen science presents a unique set of challenges and lags behind terrestrial citizen science, but also provides significant opportunities to work in data-poor fisheries. This paper analyses case studies of citizen science projects developed in collaboration with small-scale fishing communities in Mexico’s Pacific Ocean, Gulf of California and Caribbean Sea. The design and performance of these projects were evaluated against the previously published Ten Principles of Citizen Science, and Scientific Stages of Inquiry. Our results suggest that fisheries monitoring, submarine monitoring of no take zones, oceanographic monitoring, and the use of species identification apps by fishers meet the requirements of the published guidelines and are effective tools for involving the small-scale fishing community in science. Translating effective citizen science projects in to effective fishery management, however, is still at an early stage. Whilst citizen science data have been used locally by communities to adapt fishing practices, calculate recommendations for total allowable catches, establish and evaluate no take zones and detect range extensions of species affected by climate change, challenges remain regarding how to garner official recognition for the data, incorporate these growing sources of data into national policy, and use the data for adaptive management regimes at the national level.},

   abstract = {Muskellunge Esox masquinongy fisheries in Ohio are maintained through annual stocking of advanced fingerlings (25–30 cm) at nine reservoirs. Voluntary angler catch reporting is the principal method for monitoring (stocking and angling success) these fisheries. During 1960–2007, anglers reported catching over 47,000 Muskellunge by mailing catch cards to the Ohio Department of Natural Resources, Division of Wildlife. In 2008, a new online catch reporting system, the Muskie Angler Log (MAL), was launched. Designed in collaboration with anglers, the MAL provides important fishery data to biologists while also serving as a fishing resource for anglers. Anglers who use the MAL can view, summarize, and download their personal catches, review reservoir-specific stocking records and catch histories, and examine recent catch details that are voluntarily shared by other anglers. Catch data from the MAL is vital to the Ohio Department of Natural Resources, Division of Wildlife for characterizing fisheries, tracking fishery performance (numbers and sizes), leveraging Muskellunge management decisions, and supporting Muskellunge-specific research. Total reported catches in the MAL have increased over time, with most (six of nine) reservoirs showing increased or stable trends in reported catches. Despite increasing catch reports, annual angler participation in the MAL has declined, which could reduce the effectiveness of the system in monitoring these fisheries. It is not known whether this trend represents an actual decline in participation or is a function of the periodicity in catches among anglers. We modeled the change in the population size (λ) of anglers participating in the MAL using a mark–recapture method (Pradel model). Overall, the modeling indicated that the population of anglers using the MAL has declined since 2008, with the number of anglers belonging to a Muskellunge fishing club declining slower than that for nonclub members. Intervention methods promoting and incentivizing the use of the MAL will be required to assure that the MAL provides the necessary data for managing Muskellunge.},

   abstract = {Models for capture-recapture data are commonly used in analyses of the dynamics of fish and wildlife populations, especially for estimating vital parameters such as survival. Capture-recapture methods provide more reliable inferences than other methods commonly used in fisheries studies. However, for rare or elusive fish species, parameter estimation is often hampered by small probabilities of re-encountering tagged fish when encounters are obtained through traditional sampling methods. We present a case study that demonstrates how remote antennas for passive integrated transponder (PIT) tags can increase encounter probabilities and the precision of survival estimates from capture-recapture models. Between 1999 and 2007, trammel nets were used to capture and tag over 8,400 endangered adult Lost River suckers (Deltistes luxatus) during the spawning season in Upper Klamath Lake, Oregon. Despite intensive sampling at relatively discrete spawning areas, encounter probabilities from Cormack-Jolly-Seber models were consistently low (< 0.2) and the precision of apparent annual survival estimates was poor. Beginning in 2005, remote PIT tag antennas were deployed at known spawning locations to increase the probability of re-encountering tagged fish. We compare results based only on physical recaptures with results based on both physical recaptures and remote detections to demonstrate the substantial improvement in estimates of encounter probabilities (approaching 100%) and apparent annual survival provided by the remote detections. The richer encounter histories provided robust inferences about the dynamics of annual survival and have made it possible to explore more realistic models and hypotheses about factors affecting the conservation and recovery of this endangered species. Recent advances in technology related to PIT tags have paved the way for creative implementation of large-scale tagging studies in systems where they were previously considered impracticable.},

Which is why it's not surprising that even as our society continues to change and diversify in the 21st Century, those values endure. Our passion for wildlife and wild places, and the lengths to which we go to pursue that passion, are reflected in the preliminary findings of the 2016 National Survey of Fishing, Hunting and Wildlife-Associated Recreation. As it has since it was first conducted in 1955 – and every five years since – this detailed and rigorous survey is based on interviews with thousands of Americans from all walks of life. The preliminary 2016 findings should hearten everyone who cares about the health of our wildlife, natural landscapes and people. In 2016, more than 101 million Americans – a staggering 40 percent of the U.S. population – participated in some form of fishing, hunting or other wildlife-associated recreation such as birdwatching or outdoor photography. And in doing so, we spent an estimated $156.3 billion on equipment, travel, licenses and fees. These expenditures represent 1 percent of the nation's Gross Domestic Product – creating and supporting thousands of jobs and communities across the nation. More than 35.8 million Americans went fishing in 2016, while 11.5 million hunted and 86 million watched wildlife. This means that 14 percent of Americans 16 years of age or older fished, 5 percent hunted and 35 percent participated in wildlife watching. These findings are not just good news for the nation's economy. Revenues from the sale of licenses and tags, as well as excise taxes paid by hunters, anglers and shooters continue to support vital wildlife and habitat conservation efforts in every state and U.S. territory. And on a personal level, a growing body of scientific research suggests that we're all healthier, happier and better off in myriad ways when we spend time in nature. We will continue to analyze and refine the data gathered in 2016, releasing final numbers and a series of detailed special reports to help the conservation community use this information to connect even more Americans with their natural heritage.},

An alternate method uses remote cameras to capture images of lakes at hourly intervals over long time periods. Technicians then visually analyze the thousands of generated images for features of interest (e.g., angler counts and environmental conditions) and use those data to estimate angling effort. The problem is that the visual analysis step is time-consuming, expensive, and difficult to validate. Consequently, we elicited the strategies and best practices technicians used when analyzing images and identified bottlenecks. We then designed software, called Timelapse to better support image analysis. In use for several years, Timelapse has proven a cost-effective method of estimating angling effort in British Columbia's small lakes fisheries; it significantly eases a technician's workflow and doubles the number of images one can process per hour.},

For nearly 15 years, the California Collaborative Fisheries Research Program (CCFRP) has partnered volunteer anglers with researchers, the fishing industry, and resource managers to monitor groundfishes in California’s network of MPAs. While the program has succeeded in generating sustained biological observations, we know little about volunteer angler demography or the impact of participation on their perceptions and opinions on fisheries data or MPAs. In this study we surveyed CCFRP volunteers to learn about (a) volunteer angler demographics and attitudes toward groundfish management and stock health, (b) volunteer angler motivations for joining and staying in the program, and (c) whether participation in the program influenced volunteer angler opinions on the quality of fisheries data used in resource management and the establishment of MPAs in California. CCFRP volunteers were older and had higher fishing avidity than average within the California recreational angling community. Many self-identified as more conservation-minded than their peers in the recreational fishing community and had positive views of California groundfish management and stock health. Participation in science and giving back to fisheries resources were major motivating factors in their decision to become and remain CCFRP volunteers. Angler opinions toward MPAs were more positive after volunteering with CCFRP. Those who had volunteered for seven or more years with CCFRP were more likely than not to gain a positive opinion of MPAs. Our survey results provide evidence that long-term engagement of stakeholders in collaborative research positively influences stakeholder opinions regarding marine resource management, and highlights CCFRP’s success in engaging citizen science stakeholders in collaborative fisheries research.},

In this study, we describe the opportunities and challenges associated with angler apps as a source of recreational fisheries data, and propose minimum standards for data collection via angler apps. Angler apps are a potentially valuable source of conventional and novel data that are both frequent and extensive, and an opportunity to engage anglers through data sharing and citizen science. Realizing this potential requires that we address significant challenges related to angler recruitment and retention, data quality and bias, and integration with existing fisheries programmes. We propose solutions to each of these challenges. Given that the angler app market is diverse, competitive and unpredictable, we emphasize minimum standards for data collection as a way to ensure large and reliable data sets that can be compared and integrated across apps. These standards relate to trips and catches, and angler demographics and behaviour, and should be supported through consultation and research. Angler apps have the potential to fundamentally change how anglers interact with the resource and with management.},

Previous research on central and southwest Gulf of Mexico fisheries showed that most tarpon can survive short-term catch-and-release fishing practices. However, fishing pressure is intense during peak season, and tarpon fishing varies in time and space throughout the state. In this study, a novel method of obtaining fish tissue replaced traditional fin clipping, and citizen-scientists were utilized to collect DNA samples and record capture information from tarpon they caught. Benefits of using citizen scientists included being able to sample fish statewide and collect data on a species that is difficult to catch in great number. From the pilot study in 2005 through the study’s end in 2014, 24,572 samples were received from volunteer anglers throughout the coastal southeastern United States, and of those, 22,992 were collected from tarpon caught in Florida waters. tarpon samples were returned from fish caught along the Gulf and Atlantic Coasts and Florida Keys, but regionally the database was depauperate in samples from north Florida. Public outreach was a critical and integral component of study promotion and angler involvement. Future work based on recapture data will provide information needed to estimate recapture rates, evaluate seasonal and regional movement patterns, determine site fidelity, establish connectivity of tarpon in Florida waters and over the long-term could determine if juvenile tarpon sampled within Florida nursery habitats supply the adult fishery.},

Individual benefits (except those related to learning) or subjective norms (“peer pressure”) were not important motivations. Participating anglers shared motivations in common with citizen scientists in other fields. Satisfaction with fisheries management and science was similar between participants and nonparticipants, indicating that dissatisfaction with either was not a major motivation. The biggest barrier to participation for nonparticipants (i.e., those who enrolled in the program but never entered data) was lack of knowledge about the program, and a decrease in fishing; the time it takes to enter data, software difficulties, and forgetting were also cited.

   abstract = {Marine recreational fishing (MRF) is a popular activity that involves millions of people worldwide. While the impacts of recreational fishing on freshwater ecosystems received increasing attention in recent decades, the consequences of MRF on marine fish and ecosystems are largely unstudied. MRF takes place mainly in coastal areas where most of its impacts concentrate. This review identified and ranked the activities and potential risks associated with MRF using a risk assessment matrix based on ecological and fisheries-related literature. The majority of the impacts were rated to be of minor importance (impacts that occur locally, are reversible, and comparably easy to manage on local scales). Three impacts were ranked as high-risk impacts (severe impacts that are difficult to reverse and to manage, and that may require management measures on a broad spatial scale): (1) the direct and indirect impacts of high and selective fishing mortality (truncation of the natural age and size structure, depensatory mechanisms, loss of genetic variability, evolutionary changes, and food web changes) because they potentially contribute to the decline of fish stocks and undermine biodiversity and ecological resilience, (2) the use of live bait organisms that originate from water bodies elsewhere because released or lost live bait organisms potentially impact the genetic, species, and ultimately ecosystem diversity, and (3) the loss of lead containing fishing tackle that potentially causes environmental contamination. The separation of MRF-induced impacts from other anthropogenic impacts is difficult and the impacts vary according to country-specific fishing practices, legislation, and cultural backgrounds. It can nonetheless be concluded that MRF can impact fish populations and coastal environments. In particular, the high-risk impacts require further investigations as information on their effects on marine fish stocks and ecosystems are generally sparse. Finally, the review outlines management implications for sustainable marine recreational fisheries that match the temporal and spatial scale of both the marine environment affected and the recreational fishing effort and proposes areas for future research.},

There has been growing interest by recreational fishing groups and researchers in the perceived physical and psychological health and social (or ‘biopsychosocial’) benefits of recreational fishing. However, quantifying the key subjective ‘human dimensions’ of fishing that satisfy both the needs of recreational fishing groups and fishery managers is a major obstacle. We propose the use of psychometrically valid health-related quality of life (HRQOL) measures widely used in the medical and health sciences – namely the Short-Form Health Survey (SF-36) – as rapid, reliable and cost-effective instruments for quantifying HRQOL of recreational fishers. The widespread use of SF-36 and availability of population normative data allows comparisons of the HRQOL of recreational fishers across multiple temporal and spatial scales, with participants of other activities, and the general population. The use of such measures in periodic surveys allows the biopsychosocial status of a recreational fishery's participants to be assessed using a modified Kobe plot, a graphical format that is easily interpretable and consistent with existing reporting formats used in fisheries stock assessment. Future biopsychosocial research in recreational fisheries can further benefit from interdisciplinary collaboration to develop a suite of standardized psychometrically valid and reliable instruments for assessing specific issues that commonly affect recreational fisheries from regional to international scales, such as drivers of fisher motivation, behaviour and satisfaction.},

Similar to the propensity to engage in voluntary catch-and-release, the propensity to harvest fishes strongly varies among cultures, locations, species and fisheries. There is a misconception that because recreational fishing happens during non-work (i.e. leisure) time, the nutritional motivation is negligible; therefore, the role of recreational fishing in supporting nutrition (and thus food security) at regional, national or global scales is underappreciated. We consider the factors that influence whether fish will be harvested or released by examining the motives that underlie recreational fishing. Next, we provide an overview of the magnitude and role of recreational fishing harvest in supporting nutrition using regional case-studies. Then, we address issues such as contaminants and parasites that constrain the ability of fish harvested by recreational fishers to be consumed. Although recreational fishing is foremost a leisure activity, the harvest of fish for personal consumption by recreational fishers has contributed and will continue to contribute to human nutrition by providing an accessible, affordable and generally highly sustainable food source, notwithstanding concerns about food safety and possibly overfishing. Attempts to better quantify the role of fish harvested by recreational fishers and the relative contribution to overall food security and personal nutrition will provide resource managers and policymakers the information needed to guide management activities and policy development.},

   abstract = {Although it is assumed that the outcomes from scientific research inform management and policy, the so-called knowledge–action gap (i.e., the disconnect between scientific knowledge and its application) is a recognition that there are many reasons why new knowledge is not always embraced by knowledge users. The concept of knowledge co-production has gained popularity within the environmental and conservation research communities as a mechanism of bridging the gap between knowledge and action, but has yet to be fully embraced in fisheries research. Here we describe what co-production is, outline its benefits (relative to other approaches to research) and challenges, and provide practical guidance on how to embrace and enact knowledge co-production within fisheries research. Because co-production is an iterative and context-dependent process, there is no single way to do it, but there are best practices that can facilitate the generation of actionable research through respectful and inclusive partnerships. We present several brief case studies where we describe examples of where co-production has worked in practice and the benefits it has accrued. As more members of the fisheries science and management community effectively engage in co-production, it will be important to reflect on the processes and share lessons with others. We submit that co-production has manifold benefits for applied science and should lead to meaningful improvements in fisheries management, conservation, and governance.},

This 'individual specialisation' is a widespread phenomenon in natural populations, but until recently few studies quantified the magnitude of individual specialisation and how this magnitude varies among populations or contexts. Such quantitative approaches are necessary for us to understand how ecological interactions influence the amount of among-individual variation, and how the amount of variation might affect ecological dynamics. Herein, we review recent studies of individual specialisation, emphasising the novel insights arising from quantitative measures of diet variation. Experimental and comparative studies have confirmed long-standing theoretical expectations that the magnitude of among-individual diet variation depends on the level of intra and interspecific competition, ecological opportunity and predation. In contrast, there is little empirical information as to how individual specialisation affects community dynamics. We discuss some emerging methodological issues as guidelines for researchers studying individual specialisation, and make specific recommendations regarding avenues for future research. © 2011 Blackwell Publishing Ltd/CNRS.},

The Gulf of Mexico is an open and dynamic marine ecosystem rich in natural resources but heavily impacted by human activities, including agricultural, industrial, commercial and coastal development. The Gulf of Mexico has been continuously exposed to petroleum hydrocarbons for millions of years from natural oil and gas seeps on the sea floor, and more recently from oil drilling and production activities located in the water near and far from shore. Major accidental oil spills in the Gulf are infrequent; two of the most significant include the Ixtoc I blowout in the Bay of Campeche in 1979 and the Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill in 2010. Unfortunately, baseline assessments of the status of habitats and biota in the Gulf of Mexico before these spills either were not available, or the data had not been systematically compiled in a way that would help scientists assess the potential short-term and long-term effects of such events. This 2-volume series compiles and summarizes thousands of data sets showing the status of habitats and biota in the Gulf of Mexico before the Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill. Volume 1 covers: water and sediment quality and contaminants in the Gulf; natural oil and gas seeps in the Gulf of Mexico; coastal habitats, including flora and fauna and coastal geology; offshore benthos and plankton, with an analysis of current knowledge on energy capture and energy flows in the Gulf; and shellfish and finfish resources that provide the basis for commercial and recreational fisheries.},

   abstract = {The majority of the world's fisheries, by number, are data-poor/limited, and there is a growing body of literature pertaining to approaches to estimate data-limited stock status. There are at least two drivers for assessing the status of data-limited fisheries. The first is to try to understand and report on the global or regional status of fisheries across many stocks. The second is to attempt to assess individual data-limited stocks, for status reporting and/or guiding management decisions. These drivers have led to attempts to find simple, generic, low-cost solutions, including the broad application of generically parameterised models, and the blanket application of a single, or limited number of possible, analytical approach(es). It is unclear that generic methods function as intended, especially when taken out of their original design context or used without care. If the intention is to resolve individual stock status for the purposes of management, there is concern with the indiscriminate application of a single method to a suite of stocks irrespective of the particular circumstances of each. We examine why caution needs to be exercised, and provide guidance on the appropriate application of data-limited assessment methods (DLMs). We recommend: (a) obtaining better data, (b) using care in acknowledging and interpreting uncertainties in the results of DLMs, (c) embedding DLMs in harvest strategies that are robust to the higher levels of uncertainty in the output of DLMs by including precautionary management measures or buffers and (d) selecting and applying DLMs appropriate to specific species’ and fisheries’ data and context.},

This poses a challenge for the sustainable management of these stocks. Recent requirements to set scientifically based catch limits in several countries, and growing consumer demand for sustainably managed fish have spurred an emerging field of methods for estimating overfishing thresholds and setting catch limits for stocks with limited data. Using a management strategy evaluation framework we quantified the performance of a number of data-limited methods. For most life-histories, we found that methods that made use of only historical catches often performed worse than maintaining current fishing levels. Only those methods that dynamically accounted for changes in abundance and/or depletion performed well at low stock sizes. Stock assessments that make use of historical catch and effort data did not necessarily out-perform simpler data-limited methods that made use of fewer data. There is a high value of additional information regarding stock depletion, historical fishing effort and current abundance when only catch data are available. We discuss the implications of our results for other data-limited methods and identify future research priorities. © 2013 The Authors.},

Two morphologically indistinguishable species of bonefish (Albula vulpes and Albula goreensis) occur in coastal areas of the tropical western Atlantic. Growth rates of A. vulpes, which supports an economically important sport fishery, differ among locations where they have been studied, but many locations have not yet been examined. To investigate bonefish growth in Cuba, specimens were obtained from fish markets at three sites around the periphery of the island from November 2016 to January 2017. Sagittal otoliths (for aging) and fin clips (for genetics) were collected from each fish, and sex was determined by examining gonads. A total of 218 bonefish were sampled, with size ranging from 187-530mm fork length (FL), genetic testing indicated that 134 were A. vulpes, 59 were A. goreensis, and seven were hybrids. The oldest fish collected were eight and nine years old for A. vulpes and A. goreensis respectively. A. vulpes females reached larger sizes than males. The overall von Bertalanffy growth model of the two-different species were significantly different. A. vulpes grew to larger sizes than A. goreensis. Almost all A. vulpes greater than 210 mm FL in Cuba were reproductively mature, while 50% size at maturity in Florida occurs at a mean size between 418 mm and 488 mm FL. The insight of different growth patterns between A. vulpes and A. goreensis allows for better management of the species, and further distinguishes differences in the biology of A. vulpes and A. goreensis.},

   abstract = {In 1995, the Stock Assessment Team (SAT) of the Gulf States Marine Fisheries Commission (GSMFC) proposed a manual to facilitate consistent, quality age determination of exploited Gulf of Mexico fishes and outline methodologies employed by the Gulf’s marine agencies to process the hard parts. The SAT recognized that its charge to integrate state-specific stock assessments for GSMFC fishery management plans would require consistent criteria for age determinations of fishes throughout the Gulf. Therefore, a work group of experienced fisheries professionals was assembled to develop and expand this manual. The work group is comprised of two individuals from each state agency along with contributors from academia and the National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration’s (NOAA’s) National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS). The original ‘otolith manual’ was completed in 2003 after two years of effort by the work group. The revision to the manual was begun almost immediately after its initial printing but due to a number of events such as hurricanes Katrina and Rita in 2005 and funding issues, the revision was delayed. The Second Edition is a continuation of the standardization effort developed previously by the Gulf States Marine Fisheries Commission’s Otolith Work Group. This revision has contributions from a number of individuals from the original publication. In total, fourteen state agencies, federal laboratories, and universities provided material and/or reviews for this edition. Again, because the majority of fish ages in the Gulf states are determined by otolith interpretation, this manual focuses primarily on otoliths although more time is dedicated to the alternate techniques such as scales and fin spines. This edition includes several additional species for which data are currently being collected under the Gulf’s Fisheries Information Network, or FIN Program. Those FIN species have been identified for stock assessment in NOAA’s Southeast Data, Assessment, and Review (SEDAR) process in the near future. Standardization of the techniques for them should facilitate a smoother assessment process. In addition, several new or improved processing techniques have been added or modified from the original descriptions. We have tried to provide information on all the various techniques that have proven to be useful or unsuccessful for each of the species covered in Section 5.0 and we have updated each species ensuring that validation is included where possible. As always, when new species are added to the manual in the future, these techniques will be expanded where appropriate. These additions will be available on-line at the GSMFC website (www.gsmfc.org) or through the Gulf States Marine Fisheries Commission office.},

   abstract = { Tracking studies for invasive lionfish ( Pterois volitans and P. miles ) in the Western Atlantic can provide key information on habitat use to inform population control, but to date have likely underestimated home range size and movement due to constrained spatial and temporal scales. We tracked 35 acoustically tagged lionfish for >1 yr (March 2018-May 2019) within a 35 km 2 acoustic array in Buck Island Reef National Monument, St. Croix, US Virgin Islands (an area 10× larger than previous studies). Tracking lionfish at this scale revealed that home range size is 3-20 times larger than previously estimated and varies more than 8-fold across individuals (~48000-379000 m 2 ; average: 101000 m 2 ), with estimates insensitive to assumptions about potential mortality for low-movement individuals. Lionfish move far greater distances than previously reported, with 37% of fish traveling >1 km from the initial tagging site toward deeper habitats, and 1 individual moving ~10 km during a 10 d period. Movement rates, home range size, and maximum distance traveled were not related to lionfish size (18-35 cm total length) or lunar phase. Lionfish movement was lowest at night and greatest during crepuscular periods, with fish acceleration (m s -2 ) increasing with water temperature during these times. Our results help reconcile observed patterns of rapid recolonization following lionfish removal, and suggest complex drivers likely result in highly variable patterns of movement for similarly sized fish occupying the same habitat. Culling areas ≥ the average lionfish home range size identified here (i.e. ~10 ha) or habitat patches isolated by ≥ ~180 m (radius of average home range) may minimize subsequent recolonization. If the shallow-deep long-distance movements observed here are unidirectional, mesophotic habitats may require culling at relatively greater frequencies to counteract ongoing migration. },

   abstract = {The Mediterranean Sea is classified as a “data-poor” region in fisheries due to its low number of assessed stocks given its biodiversity and number of exploited species. In this study, the CMSY method was applied to assess the status and exploitation levels of 54 commercial fish and invertebrate stocks belonging to 34 species fished by Turkish fleets in the Eastern Mediterranean (Levantine) and Black Seas, by using catch data and resilience indices. Most of these marine taxa currently lack formal stock assessments. The CMSY method uses a surplus production model (SPM), based on official catch statistics and an abundance index derived from scientific surveys. The SPM estimates maximum sustainable yield (MSY), fishing mortality (F), biomass (B), fishing mortality to achieve sustainable catches (Fmsy), and the biomass to support sustainable catches (Bmsy). Our results show the estimated biomass values for 94% of the stocks were lower than the required amount to support sustainable fisheries (Bmsy). Of the 54 stocks, 85% of them can be deemed as overfished; two stocks were not subject to overfishing (Sardina pilchardus and Trachurus mediterraneus in the Marmara Sea) while only one stock (Sprattus sprattus in the Black Sea) is healthy and capable of producing MSY. Annual values of the stock status indicators, F/Fmsy and B/Bmsy, had opposing trends in all regions, suggesting higher stock biomasses could only be achieved if fishing mortality is drastically reduced. Recovery times and levels were then explored under four varying F/Fmsy scenarios. Under the best-case scenario (i.e., F = 0.5Fmsy), over 60% of the stocks could be rebuilt by 2032. By contrast, if normal fishing practices continue as usual, all stocks will soon be depleted [if not already] (F = 0.95Fmsy), whose recover may be impossible at later dates. The results of this study are supported by previous regional assessments confirming the overexploitation of Turkish fisheries is driving the near-total collapse of these marine wild fisheries. Hence, the need to urgently rebuild Turkey’s marine fisheries ought to be prioritized to ensure their future viability.},

It also presents a Bayesian state-space implementation of the Schaefer production model (BSM), fitted to catch and biomass or catch-per-unit-of-effort (CPUE) data. Special emphasis was given to derive informative priors for productivity, unexploited stock size, catchability and biomass from population dynamics theory. Both models gave good predictions of the maximum intrinsic rate of population increase r, unexploited stock size k and maximum sustainable yield MSY when validated against simulated data with known parameter values. CMSY provided, in addition, reasonable predictions of relative biomass and exploitation rate. Both models were evaluated against 128 real stocks, where estimates of biomass were available from full stock assessments. BSM estimates of r, k and MSY were used as benchmarks for the respective CMSY estimates and were not significantly different in 76% of the stocks. A similar test against 28 data-limited stocks, where CPUE instead of biomass was available, showed that BSM and CMSY estimates of r, k and MSY were not significantly different in 89% of the stocks. Both CMSY and BSM combine the production model with a simple stock–recruitment model, accounting for reduced recruitment at severely depleted stock sizes.},

Data-limited stock assessments are increasingly used where model-based, data-rich approaches are not possible. However, their widespread use is constrained by several important limitations, especially the inability to estimate biomass or maximum sustainable yield (MSY)-based reference points. Here we applied several data-limited stock assessments and utilized expert opinion to identify early warning signs of depletion in the rapidly growing Southern California (CA) rock crab fishery, a small scale yet economically valuable fishery being managed with relatively limited information. We chose our specific assessment methods with the aid of a decision support tool (FishPath) designed to help identify context-appropriate options for assessing and managing fisheries. Results of five assessments indicated that serial depletion, regional overfishing, and effort creep may be occurring in the rock crab fishery. Expert opinion regarding changes in fishery operations and fishing effort provided vital insights for interpreting assessment results. We illustrate a general path for enhancing understanding of fishery impacts in a data-limited fishery, and sound rationale for proactive management to address warning signs of overfishing in the southern CA rock crab fishery.},

   abstract = {Managing coastal fisheries is challenging as the status of many fish stocks caught in these fisheries remains unknown. In the South African linefishery, regular comprehensive assessments of the status of most linefish stocks are unattainable owing to a scarcity of reliable long-term data. Length-based analysis remains the only option to determine stock status in the form of spawning potential ratio (SPR), as life-history information and representative length samples are available for many linefish species. Although per-recruit models are susceptible to bias due to violation of the steady-state assumption, the SPR has been shown to be robust for long-lived species under reasonably consistent fishing mortality. In this study we used observer-collected length-frequency data from two time-periods 20 years apart (1988–1990 and 2008–2010), before and after management regulations were implemented, in combination with life-history information, to estimate the SPRs for 17 linefish species. We then correlated the recent stock-status estimates to species-specific life-history traits to identify length-based indicators of susceptibility to exploitation. Most species showed improvements in SPR between the periods, caused mainly by decreases in fishing mortality (F) and also increases in length-at-first-capture (Lc). The ratio between Lc and asymptotic length (Lc /L ∞), and the ratio between Lc and optimum length (Lc /L opt), had significant relationships with SPR. We suggest that length-based indicators could be used to classify risk to overfishing in data-poor fisheries for medium- to long-lived species when time-series data are not attainable, but where representative size samples and adequate life-history information exist.},

   abstract = {Length measurements from fishery catch can be used in data-limited assessments to estimate important population parameters to guide management, but results are highly sensitive to assumptions about biological information. Ideally, local life history studies inform biological parameters. In the absence of reliable local estimates, scientists and managers face the difficult task of agreeing on fixed values for life-history parameters, often leading to additional uncertainty unquantified in the assessment or indecision defaulting to status-quo management. We propose an ensemble approach for incorporating life history uncertainty into data-limited stock assessments. We develop multivariate distributions of growth, mortality, and maturity parameter values, then use bivariate interpolation and stacking as an ensemble learning algorithm to propagate uncertainty into length-based, data-limited stock assessment models. Simulation testing demonstrated that stacking across life history parameter values leads to improved interval coverage over simple model averaging or assuming the parameter distribution means when the true life-history parameter values are unknown. We then applied the stacking approach for a U.S. Caribbean stock where the Scientific and Statistical Committee did not accept the assessment due to uncertainty in life history parameters. Stacking can better characterize uncertainty in stock status whenever life-history parameters are unknown but likely parameter distributions are available.},

The dependency on marine fish supplies keeps rising globally leading to intense competition, fishery conflicts and unsustainable fishing practices which threatens the sustainability and leading to the depletion of marine fishery resources. Andaman and Nicobar Islands (ANI) in India is a tropical archipelago cited as an example where marine fishery resources were considered to be highly underutilized vis-a-vis the harvestable potential. Developmental plans often envisage the enormous scope to harness the oceanic fishery resources however, the overriding issues which affect the sustainable fishery management were least understood or addressed. Offshore fisheries were trade and economy based whereas small scale fisheries are livelihood and food security-based, operating with small to medium scale commercial prospects. Radical management approaches in artisanal and industrial fisheries is essential to foster community resilience and sustainable fishery management. The emerging body of evidence suggests the critical need to reliably estimate the fish catches and population dynamics for sustainable fisheries management. Comprehensive opinions on prevailing issues, complexities in governance, challenges faced and the management strategies that need to be adopted were discussed to ensure the robust governance and sustainability of marine fisheries sector.},

   abstract = {Sustainable fisheries management is built on effective management strategies and informative data that are usually well defined for data-rich fisheries. However, their counterparts in data-limited fisheries remain inadequately evaluated due to insufficient data for stock assessments. This raises two questions: (1) can data-limited management strategies achieve sustainable fisheries and (2) are certain types of data more informative than others are in developing sustainable data-limited fisheries? To address these questions, we performed management strategy evaluation with data-rich stocks to simulate data-limited fisheries management. The performance of data-limited management procedures (MPs) was compared with the performance of management strategies that are based on data-rich stock assessments. We examined the informative nature of six data categories in data-limited situations by developing a tier system that mimicked different data availability levels and evaluating their contributions to management success. Our study showed that it is possible to achieve maximum sustainable yield (MSY) with limited data, given the proper choice of MPs. In addition, the data categories were not equally informative to the development of sustainable data-limited fisheries management. In our case study, the MPs using the data on stock size and quantitative management targets (target proxy) demonstrated the highest management success rates. The most effective (100% management success rate) while least data-demanding MPs included minlenLopt1, SPMSY, MCD, Itarget1, and ICI. We also confirmed that the performance of the data-limited MPs was closely related to historical stock dynamics and levels of data availability. We suggest considering historical stock trends and data availability levels as critical prerequisites in the management of data-limited fisheries.},

However, inconsistencies between individual δ<sup>18</sup>O records within biogenic specimens commonly have significant impacts on environmental reconstructions. This study addresses the stable isotope variability associated with sample milling from aragonitic organisms commonly used for paleoclimate studies. Methods: Aragonite samples were hand-ground and milled from sclerosponge, coral, and mollusc specimens using a computerized micromill. An X-ray diffractometer was used to analyze sample mineralogy prior to measurement of δ<sup>18</sup>O and δ<sup>13</sup>C values via isotope ratio mass spectrometry of CO<inf>2</inf> gases provided from the samples by a Kiel III device. Possible influences on the Sr/Ca ratios were assessed on a sclerosponge through paired elemental analysis by inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry. Results: Analyses revealed up to 36% inversion to calcite in milled samples that correlated with a decrease in the δ<sup>18</sup>O value of 0.02 ‰ per 1% inversion. Replicate sclerosponge transects yielded similar trends in δ<sup>13</sup>C values and Sr/Ca ratios, although the δ<sup>18</sup>O values showed irregular variations consistent with those measured for the inversion of individual organisms during milling. Conclusions: While the δ<sup>13</sup>C values and Sr/Ca ratios of milled samples were largely consistent, the δ<sup>18</sup>O values co-varied with the inversion of aragonite to calcite suggesting significant implications for the resulting temperature and salinity reconstructions from aragonitic archives. The effect appears to be density-driven and, given that the skeletal density tends to vary seasonally in organisms such as corals, would subsequently mask temperature-induced changes in skeletal δ<sup>18</sup>O values.},

   abstract = {Understanding the factors that influence species’ distributions is crucial for implementing effective management and conservation practices, yet difficult for highly vagile species like sharks. Many shark species demonstrate either spatial and/or temporal sexual segregation, further confounding accurate quantification of habitat suitability. Given the importance of understanding spatiotemporal patterns in the distribution of coastal shark assemblages, we sought to quantify sex-specific abiotic factors that influence seasonal variation in a coastal shark assemblage using data from a long-term fisheries-independent bottom longline program in the northern Gulf of Mexico. Catch data (individuals/100 hooks/hour) were coupled with a suite of potentially predictive variables: surface and bottom values for temperature (°C) and salinity (psu), sea surface height (m), three-dimensional surface and bottom current velocity (u, v, w, in m/s), bottom dissolved oxygen (mg/l), depth (m), substrate grain size (mm), daylength (min), and distance from shore (km). Data were analyzed using boosted regression trees (BRT) to describe the relationships between catch data and environmental factors potentially influencing sex-specific species distribution and abundance. Between May 2006 and November 2018, we conducted 1,226 bottom longline sets and caught 13,742 individuals encompassing 67 species. The majority of the animals captured (74%) were elasmobranchs, primarily sharks. Two species from each of the following three categories were selected for further analyses: small coastal sharks (Atlantic sharpnose shark Rhizoprionodon terraenovae and blacknose shark Carcharhinus acronotus), large coastal sharks (blacktip shark C. limbatus and sandbar shark C. plumbeus), and shelf-associated sharks (smoothhound sharks, Mustelus spp. and scalloped hammerhead Sphyrna lewini). Depth and distance from shore were the strongest predictors of distribution and relative abundance, followed by longitude and bottom salinity; other factors (e.g., temperature, daylength, substrate grain size) were less predictive. For the six species examined, predictive factors were often the same for males and females, although the range of preferred values varied. Surprisingly, the importance of these predictors varied little across seasons. Collectively, our findings demonstrate that sexual segregation is the norm for sharks in the north-central Gulf of Mexico. Long-term fishery-independent monitoring to further quantify these sex-based differences in habitat use should be prioritized, particularly in light of impending climate change.},

Both methods help to calculate the maximum sustainable yield (MSY) and exploitation of MSY relative to biomass (B/BMSY). The results of maximum intrinsic rate (r) and carrying capacity are also estimated. The results revealed that all tuna stocks in both the regions were overfished, with one, the longtail tuna (Thunnus tonggol) in the Western Indian Ocean strongly overfished (B/BMSY = 0.44). Such observations, although still preliminary since the techniques used to produce them are relatively new, often associated with the situation and exploitation of all the stock in question, making the CMSY and BSM methods promising for stock assessment in data-deficit situations. The study concludes that in order to restore the status of these five tuna stocks in both regions, it would be necessary to reduce the fishing pressure.},

This study investigates shifting baseline effects in official stock assessments from the Ransom Myers Legacy Stock Assessment Database that used truncated catch time series.

Multiple COMs were fitted to a time series of total pike removals, and their outputs were used as explanatory variables in ensemble models.

While all life stages of tiger sharks are known to occur in the Gulf of Mexico (GoM), variability in habitat use and movement patterns over ontogeny have never been quantified in this large marine ecosystem. To address this data gap we fitted 56 tiger sharks with Smart Position and Temperature transmitting tags between 2010 and 2018 and examined seasonal and spatial distribution patterns across the GoM. Additionally, we analyzed overlap of core habitats (i.e., 50% kernel density estimates) among individuals relative to large benthic features (oil and gas platforms, natural banks, bathymetric breaks). Our analyses revealed significant ontogenetic and seasonal differences in distribution patterns as well as across-shelf (i.e., regional) and sex-linked variability in movement rates. Presumably sub-adult and adult sharks achieved significantly higher movement rates and used off-shelf deeper habitats at greater proportions than juvenile sharks, particularly during the fall and winter seasons. Further, female maximum rate of movement was higher than males when accounting for size. Additionally, we found evidence of core regions encompassing the National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration designated Habitat Areas of Particular Concern (i.e., shelf-edge banks) during cooler months, particularly by females, as well as 2,504 oil and gas platforms. These data provide a baseline for future assessments of environmental impacts, such as climate variability or oil spills, on tiger shark movements and distribution in the region. Future research may benefit from combining alternative tracking tools, such as acoustic telemetry and genetic approaches, which can facilitate long-term assessment of the species’ movement dynamics and better elucidate the ecological significance of the core habitats identified here.},

Numerous antiemetics have been studied for the prevention and treatment of PONV in patients scheduled for laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Traditional antiemetics, including anticholinergics (e.g., scopolamine), antihistamines (e.g., dimenhydrinate), phenothiazines (e.g., promethazine), butyrophenones (e.g., droperidol), and benzamide (e.g., metoclopramide), are used for the control of PONV. The available nontraditional antiemetics for the prophylaxis against PONV are dexamethasone and propofol. Serotonin receptor antagonists (ondansetron, granisetron, tropisetron, dolasetron, and ramosetron), compared with traditional antiemetics, are highly efficacious for PONV. The prophylactic ondansetron, granisetron, tropisetron, and dolasetron in antiemetic efficacy are comparable. Ramosetron is effective for the long-term prevention of PONV. None of the available antiemetics is entirely effective, perhaps because most of them act through the blockade on one type of receptor. There is a possibility that combined antiemetics with different sites of activity would be more effective than one drug alone for the prophylaxis against PONV. Combination antiemetic therapy is often effective for the prevention of PONV following laparoscopic cholecystectomy. The efficacy of a combination of serotonin receptor antagonists (ondansetron and granisetron) and droperidol is superior to monotherapy with a serotonin receptor antagonist or droperidol. Similarly, adding dexamethasone to ondansetron or granisetron improves antiemetic efficacy in PONV. Knowledge regarding antiemetics is necessary to completely prevent and treatment of PONV in patients scheduled for laparoscopic cholecystectomy.},

To determine if otolith composition is a valid tracer of specific nursery sites and can be used to classify adult fish to their nursery area, chemical concentrations in juvenile gag otoliths (Li, Na, K, Mg, Ca, Sr, Ba, Mn, Cu, Pb, δ13C and δ18O,) were measured for 4 nursery areas along the Florida west coast in 1992, 1995 and 1996. Classification of fish to nursery area was by parametric discriminant function analysis and neural network simulation; both gave similar results in the spatial and temporal patterns of classification error and in identification of important classification variables (Mn, Sr and δ13C). Classification success rates ranged from 66 to 100%. Interannual variability in otolith composition had a negative effect on classification success rate at the spatial scale of site separation (<200 km). At regional spatial scales (>300 km) the year effect was reduced and classification success remained high without consideration of year class. Analysis of classification errors supports the separation of sites into northern and southern groups. The observed negative trend in otolith Sr and positive trend in otolith Mn with increasing latitude are positively correlated with corresponding trends in groundwater Sr and sediment Mn, respectively, which are hypothesized to be the proximal causes for the otolith trends. Otolith composition is a valid technique for classifying juvenile gag to estuarine habitats along the west coast of Florida. Classification error rates of less than 10% are obtained when the year class of the fish is considered. Similar error rates were achieved across multi-year data at regional spatial scales.},

   abstract = {Many predictive models of spatial and temporal distribution (e.g. in response to climate change or species introductions) assume that species have one environmental niche that applies to all individuals. However, there is growing evidence that individuals can have environmental preferences that are narrower than the species niche. Such individual specialization has mainly been studied in terms of dietary niches, but a recent increase in the availability of individual movement data opens the possibility of extending these analyses to specialisation in environmental preferences. Yet, no study to date on individual specialisation has considered the environmental niche in its multidimensionality. Here we propose a new method for quantifying individual specialisation in multiple dimensions simultaneously. We compare the hypervolumes in n-dimensional environmental niche space of each individual against that of the population, testing for significant differences against a null model. The same method can be applied to a 2-dimensional geographic space to test for site fidelity. We applied this method to test for individual environmental specialisation (across three dimensions: sea surface temperature, eddy kinetic energy, depth) and for site fidelity among satellite-tracked black-browed albatrosses (Thalassarche melanophris) and grey-headed albatrosses (Thalassarche chrysostoma), during chick-rearing at South Georgia. We found evidence for site fidelity in both species and of environmental specialisation among individual grey-headed but not black-browed albatrosses. Specialisation can affect the resilience of populations affected by natural and anthropogenic changes in the environment, and hence has implications for population dynamics and conservation.},

This study reviews methods for quantifying scientific uncertainty for presentation as part of the scientific advice to fisheries managers. We surveyed stock assessment scientists to a) identify the methods commonly used to quantify uncertainty, b) describe how method use has changed over time, c) investigate the factors that influence which methods are used, and d) characterize how scientific uncertainty is presented to fisheries managers. We found that scientific uncertainty is being quantified and included in scientific advice across multiple fishery management systems. Frequentist approaches for quantifying uncertainty are used more broadly than Bayesian approaches, and the survey did not detect this changing over time. Time restrictions and methodology requests during the scientific review process were commonly reported as factors influencing the use of uncertainty methods. Uncertainty in estimates of management targets (e.g., fishing mortality or biomass), projections, and catch limits were the quantities most frequently included in the scientific advice presented to fisheries managers. Methods for quantifying uncertainty and their incorporation into management advice are quickly advancing, and our approaches for reviewing progress towards clearly and explicitly communicating the sources, treatment, and impacts of uncertainty in management processes must keep pace.},

The ocean and the freshwater ecosystems of the world make significant contributions to people's well-being via the many vital social and environmental services they provide (for example, food and nutrition, employment and incomes, carbon cycling and sequestration). The impact that the increase in fishing since the 1950s has had on wild fish stocks, and the significant increase in aquaculture production in the 20th century, have resulted in severe environmental impacts. This has significant effects on marine ecosystems and the health of oceans. The erosion of the resource undermines communities' long-term interests, including food security, employment, and income. Attempts by the global community to address challenges of sustainable production by improving the governance and management of fisheries resources range from national management of fisheries resources, to regional fisheries management organisations (RFMOs) for international fisheries stocks. These attempts have not always successfully met the challenge of balancing current and future use of fisheries.},

This implies that harvest rate targets should be lower than has often been assumed, especially when stock size assessments are uncertain. In the end, the high cost of information for accurate stock assessment may call for an alternative approach to management, involving regulation of exploitation rate via measures such as large-scale closures (refuges) that directly restrict the proportion of fish available to harvest. Development of predictive models for such regulatory options is a major challenge for fisheries assessment science. © 1996 Chapman & Hall.},

   abstract = {This contribution, which reviews some broad trends in human history and in the history of fishing, argues that sustainability, however defined, rarely if ever occurred as a result of an explicit policy, but as result of our inability to access a major part of exploited stocks. With the development of industrial fishing, and the resulting invasion of the refuges previously provided by distance and depth, our interactions with fisheries resources have come to resemble the wars of extermination that newly arrived hunters conducted 40 000-50 000 years ago in Australia, and 12 000-13 000 years ago against large terrestrial mammals in North America. These broad trends are documented here through a map of change in fish sizes, which displays characteristic declines, first in the nearshore waters of industrialized countries of the Northern Hemisphere, then spread offshore and to the Southern Hemisphere. This geographical extension met its natural limit in the late 1980s, when the catches from newly accessed stocks ceased to compensate for the collapse in areas accessed earlier, hence leading to a gradual decline of global landing. These trends affect developing countries more than the developed world, which have been able to meet the shortfall by increasing imports from developing countries. These trends, however, together with the rapid growth of farming of carnivorous fishes, which consumes other fishes suited for human consumption, have led to serious food security issues. This promotes urgency to the implementation of the remedies traditionally proposed to alleviate overfishing (reduction of overcapacity, enforcement of conservative total allowable catches, etc.), and to the implementation of non-conventional approaches, notably the re-establishment of the refuges (also known as marine reserves), which made possible the apparent sustainability of pre-industrial fisheries. © 2005 The Royal Society.},

Sci. 51: 21 26-2146. Temporal changes in demography, population sustainability, and harvest rates support the hypothesis that overexploitation precipitated the commercial extinction of northern cod, Gadus rnorhua, off Newfoundland and Labrador in 1992. Annual estimates of realized population growth (r) indicate that the stock was rarely sustainable at the age-specific survival and fecundity rates experienced since 1962. A twofold decline in annual survival probabilities in the 1980s was concomitant with increased inshore and offshore fishing effort, declining catch rate, and spatial shifts in gillnetting effort from areas of low (inshore) to high (offshore) catch rates. We reject hypotheses that attribute the collapse of northern cod to environmental change. Water temperature was associated neither with juvenile nor adult abundance nor with adult distribution by depth. Harvests equivalent to those of the past decade were sustainable in the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries in a considerably colder environment. An updated analysis of previous work indicates that salinity has little effect on recruitment. We conclude that the collapse of northern cod can be attributed solely to overexploitation and that population sustainability indices such as r provide a means by which the susceptibility and resilience of exploited populations can be assessed and their probability of cesmrnercial extinction reduced. bes modifications terrsporelles des caracteres d6mographiques, de la durabilite des populations et des taux de r6colte soutiennent I'hypothGse selon laquelle la surexploitation a accel6r6 l'extinctiow commer-ciale de la morue du Nord, Gadus rnorhua, au large de Terre-Neuve et du Labrador en 1992.

   abstract = {Predictable fish aggregations of commercially valuable species are particularly susceptible to overexploitation. Giant trevally Caranx ignobilis are ecologically important top predatory fish targeted in both recreational and commercial fisheries; however, little is known about their aggregation dynamics or susceptibility to overexploitation. This study employed acoustic telemetry to investigate the temporal and spatial characteristics of one of the largest known aggregations of this species over a 3 yr period in a marine protected area in Mozambique, West Indian Ocean. Tagged fish were monitored for between 386 and 1176 d, during which they exhibited distinct aggregative periods in austral spring and summer. The detection frequency of fish at the aggregation site was significantly associated with rising mean sea temperatures and the full moon period. Whilst at the aggregation site, fish exhibited clear patterns of diel periodicity, with maximum hourly detections recorded during midday. All fish exhibited periods of absence from the aggregation site between summer seasons, in which time many of them ranged across an international border for distances of between 11 and 633 km before returning to aggregate at the same site in the following season. These results confirm that the studied giant trevally aggregation is temporally and spatially predictable, and consistent with a transient site-specific fish spawning aggregation. The spatiotemporal predictability of the aggregation highlights the need for the effective management of this transboundary population of giant trevally, for which this study has provided conservation management recommendations.},

However, human actions continue to fail in building adequate socio-ecological resilience to the accelerating threats of global change. Translational science, which focuses on connecting scientific research to human benefits, is imperative to building resilience to a confluence of global change threats because it brings the implications of theory and empirical research into practice. Translational ecology, an approach to knowledge co-creation that is grounded in equitable, inclusive, empathetic, and just partnerships among administrators, policy makers, scholars, practitioners, and the public, has immense potential to bring about the rapid and expansive social, ecological and political changes necessary to build resilience to global change threats. Here, we articulate a need for greater engagement of ecologists and other professionals in translational initiatives addressing seven major resilience building challenges, and propose a framework that lowers barriers to participation and promotes stronger relationships among stakeholders. We recommend specific actions that ecologists can take based on their situation, as well as evidence and demonstrated need, to foster resilience building through their contributions to communication, policy, education, knowledge creation, leadership, and service as role models. We conclude with an urgent call for expansive engagement of ecologists and other professionals in initiatives that combat misinformation, partner equitably with communities in knowledge creation, cultivate empathy and compassion, bolster public trust in science, and ultimately build decentralized communities of practice that enable rapid and high-impact responses to global change.},

The bull shark (Carcharhinus leucas) is a large, widespread coastal predator capable of undertaking long-range movement, but there is still limited understanding of intra-regional differences in movement and habitat connectivity across latitudes within the same coastline. This study used acoustic telemetry data and network analyses to investigate long-range movements, residency patterns and seasonal habitat linkages of sub-adult and adult C. leucas along the east coast of Australia. Our results revealed that C. leucas tagged in Sydney Harbour were mainly present within this temperate estuary in summer and autumn; the rest of the year individuals were detected in tropical and subtropical habitats from southern and central Queensland. In contrast, the detection probability of C. leucas tagged in the Townsville Reefs (central Great Barrier Reef) peaked in spring, with a portion of the tagged population migrating south during the summer months. Differences in residency time between tagging locations were also detected, as all C. leucas tagged in Sydney Harbour were absent between June and November, but 35% of the tropical-reef tagged population remained resident year-round. Network analyses complemented these findings by revealing different seasonal habitat use between regions, thus highlighting complex seasonal-habitat linkages of C. leucas along the coast. Our findings support the hypothesis that the timing, duration, and drivers involved in the long-range movements and connectivity of sub-adult and adult C. leucas vary between latitudinal regions, most likely driven by the interaction between seasonal temperature changes, foraging and reproduction.},

Fish migration and associated movements are key mechanisms through which discrete populations mix and are thus important determinants of population structure. Detailed information on fish migration and movements is becoming more accessible through advances in telemetry and analysis methods however such information is not yet used systematically in stock structure assessment. Here, we described how detections of acoustically tagged fish across a continental-scale array of underwater acoustic receivers were used to assess stock structure and connectivity in seven teleost and seven shark species and compared to findings from genetic and conventional tagging. Network analysis revealed previously unknown population connections in some species, and in others bolstered support for existing stock discrimination by identifying nodes and routes important for connectivity. Species with less variability in their movements required smaller sample sizes (45–50 individuals) to reveal useful stock structure information. Our study shows the power of continental-scale acoustic telemetry networks to detect movements among fishery jurisdictions. We highlight methodological issues that need to be considered in the design of acoustic telemetry studies for investigating stock structure and the interpretation of the resulting data. The advent of broad-scale acoustic telemetry networks across the globe provides new avenues to understand how movement informs population structure and can lead to improved management.},

Fishing with baited hook and line occurred in 2004 and 2005 in Onslow Bay, NC, in waters 19-150 m deep. Sub-legal discard rates were 15% for vermilion snapper, 25% for red porgy, 7% for red grouper, 33% for gag, 35% for scamp and 12% for black sea bass. Although mortality based on post-release behaviour was relatively low, higher mortalities estimated from models incorporating hooking location and depth of capture suggest that minimum size limits may not provide the population benefits intended by management in the North Carolina reef fishery. © 2007 The Authors.

   abstract = {The status of the western North Atlantic Ocean population of scalloped hammerheads Sphyrna lewini (Sphyrnidae [hammerhead sharks]) was assessed from 1981 through 2005 by using Schaefer (logistic) and Fox surplus-production models. The population declined rapidly before 1996 but began rebuilding in the late 1990s as fishing pressure decreased. The Akaike information criterion for small sample sizes-a test of goodness of fit for statistical models-indicated that the Fox model provided a slightly better fit to the data. Bootstrapped parameter values showed that in 2005 the probability of the scalloped hammerhead's being overfished was greater than 95% (the population was estimated to be 45% of that which would produce the maximum sustainable yield [MSY]) and a 73% probability that overfishing was occurring (fishing mortality was approximately 129% of that associated with the MSY). The size of this population was estimated to be 17% of what it had been in 1981, that is, it has been depleted by about 83% from the virgin stock size. Monte Carlo simulation predicted that the population had a 58% probability of rebuilding in 10 years if the 2005 catch level (4,135 individuals) were maintained and an 85% probability of rebuilding if the 2005 total catch were halved. Sensitivity analyses showed that the stock assessment results were most sensitive to removing the University of North Carolina longline survey index of relative abundance, the method of weighting indices, and excluding fishery-dependent indices of relative abundance. © Copyright by the American Fisheries Society 2009.},

   abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein−protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-α-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 Å for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21% with default Glide SP settings to 58% with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63% success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40% of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

It also presents a Bayesian state-space implementation of the Schaefer production model (BSM), fitted to catch and biomass or catch-per-unit-of-effort (CPUE) data. Special emphasis was given to derive informative priors for productivity, unexploited stock size, catchability and biomass from population dynamics theory. Both models gave good predictions of the maximum intrinsic rate of population increase r, unexploited stock size k and maximum sustainable yield MSY when validated against simulated data with known parameter values. CMSY provided, in addition, reasonable predictions of relative biomass and exploitation rate. Both models were evaluated against 128 real stocks, where estimates of biomass were available from full stock assessments. BSM estimates of r, k and MSY were used as benchmarks for the respective CMSY estimates and were not significantly different in 76% of the stocks. A similar test against 28 data-limited stocks, where CPUE instead of biomass was available, showed that BSM and CMSY estimates of r, k and MSY were not significantly different in 89% of the stocks. Both CMSY and BSM combine the production model with a simple stock–recruitment model, accounting for reduced recruitment at severely depleted stock sizes.},

   abstract = {Drawing on research in the northeastern USA and northwestern Europe, a description is given of how cooperative research is organized and a statement made of how involving fishers in research can contribute to better fisheries management. The focus is on improving stock assessments through the collection of better fishery-dependent and -independent data and through efforts to address bycatch through gear-selectivity studies. Direct benefits of cooperative research include increased quantity and quality of data, inclusion of fishers' knowledge in science and management, improved relevance of research to fisheries management, and reduced costs of science. Indirect benefits are the buy-in of science and management by industry and improved relationships and trust between fishers and scientists (and managers). These indirect benefits are best achieved under conditions of transparency and communication. In some cases, cooperative research also provides income to the industry and supports the maintenance of fishing infrastructure. Most important, cooperative research improves capacity-building and establishes intellectual property rights within the fishing industry, and it encourages innovative approaches to management, such as adaptive and ecosystem-based approaches. Finally, guidelines for making cooperative research more effective are outlined. © 2007 International Council for the Exploration of the Sea. Published by Oxford Journals. All rights reserved.},

   abstract = {Fishery-independent surveys can provide accurate and precise data for stock assessments and spatial management to sustain fishery resources as a complementary or alternative source of information to fishery-dependent sampling. Four years of underwater visual survey data collected in several local areas in the U.S. Caribbean were used in conjunction with detailed bathymetric and habitat maps to develop a probability sampling design and investigate the feasibility of conducting a regionwide coral reef fish survey. Stratification by depth and habitat produced a more efficient survey design (i.e., one with increased precision at lower sample sizes) for estimating mean fish density than simple random sampling for eight principal exploited and nontarget species. Species with higher sample variance of density required larger sample sizes to improve survey precision. A somewhat counterintuitive finding was that controlling survey precision over a large spatial scale (i.e., region) required less sampling than controlling precision for multiple smaller areas within the larger survey frame. At regionwide spatial scales relevant for fisheries management, the projected sample sizes for achieving moderately high levels of survey precision were comparable to historical annual sampling efforts. However, controlling survey precision both inside and outside spatial management zones would likely require sample sizes about twice the level of the historical effort. Our findings stress the importance of clearly defining management objectives with respect to spatial scales and target species as a prerequisite for developing precise, cost-effective fishery-independent surveys.},

At a regional (EEZ) scale, the study demonstrated that a large part of albacore CPUE variability can be explained by seasonal, interannual and spatial variation of the habitat. Results of the generalized linear models indicated that catch rates are higher than average in the northwestern part of the EEZ at the beginning of the year (January) and during the second half of the year (July-December). In the northwestern region of the EEZ, high CPUEs are associated with waters <20.5° in the intermediate layer and with moderate values of primary production. Longline CPUE also appeared to be dependent on prey densities, as predicted from a micronekton model. Albacore CPUE was highest at moderate densities of prey in the epipelagic layer during the night and for relatively low prey densities in the mesopelagic layer during the day. We also demonstrated that the highest CPUEs were recorded from 1986 to 1998, which corresponds to a period with frequent El Niño events. © 2011 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.},

   abstract = {In remote and data-limited situations such as encountered in Arctic regions, traditional ecological knowledge (TEK) is an important and valuable information source. TEK from local fishers (fishers knowledge, FK) is highly relevant to fisheries management. The integration of FK in fisheries assessments remains complicated by the lack of tools to combine scientific and FK observations. This study implements a productivity-susceptibility analysis (PSA) for assessing the risk from fishing to fish stocks and incorporate FK in the assessment process. The PSA method consists of scoring productivity attributes of fish populations and susceptibility attributes affecting fisheries exposure and intensity. The method can be adapted to incorporate FK on two levels: (1) in the validation of biological data (indirect inclusion); and (2) in the definition and scoring of independent FK attributes (direct inclusion). Risk scores measured along the productivity-susceptibility gradient serve to identify areas and populations most vulnerable to fishing activities and formulate science advice for prioritisation and management. We apply the method to small-scale fisheries for Arctic char Salvelinus alpinus in Cumberland Sound, Baffin Island, Nunavut. These fisheries are key to food security and economic growth in Canada's Arctic territories, yet management remains complicated by data paucity; by the widespread distribution and biological complexity of Arctic char stocks; and by growing uncertainties related to climate change impacts on Arctic fish and ecosystems. This paper demonstrates the usefulness of the method for combining science and FK information to improve management advice for Arctic char stocks, and applicability to other small-scale, data-limited fisheries.},

The presented methodology combines information from multiple Bayesian data analyses through the incorporation of the joint posterior probability density functions (pdfs) in subsequent analyses, either as informative prior pdfs or as additional likelihood contributions. Different practical strategies are presented for minimising any loss of information between analyses. Using this methodology, the final stock assessment model used for the provision of the management advice can be kept relatively simple, despite the dependence on a large variety of data and other information. This methodology is illustrated for the assessment of the mixed-stock fishery for four wild Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) stocks in the northern Baltic Sea. The incorporation of different data and information results in a considerable update of previously available smolt abundance and smolt production capacity estimates by substantially reducing the associated uncertainty. The methodology also allows, for the first time, the estimation of stock-recruit functions for the different salmon stocks. © 2008 NRC.},

Here, we focused on striped red mullet (Mullus surmuletus), a widespread yet data-limited species of high commercial importance. Aiming to quantify range dynamics in this data-poor scenario, we combined fishery-dependent and-independent data sets through a series of Bayesian mixed-effects models designed to capture monthly and seasonal occurrence patterns near the species’ northern range limit across 20 years. Combining multiple data sets allowed us to cover the entire distribution of the northern population of M. surmuletus, exploring dynamics at different spatiotemporal scales and identifying key environmental drivers (i.e., sea surface temperature, salinity) that shape occurrence patterns. Our results demonstrate that even when process and (or) observation uncertainty is high, or when data are sparse, if we combine multiple data sets within a hierarchical modelling framework, accurate and useful spatial predictions can still be made.},

   abstract = {The biological consequences of catch-and-release (C&R) angling revolve around interactions between the physiological and behavioural responses of the captured fish and ecological conditions such as the presence of opportunistic predators. Here, we explored the consequences of C&R on adult permit (Trachinotus falcatus), including assessments of depredation rates, their physiological and reflex responses prior to release, post-release behaviour, and post-release predation in diverse habitats in the Florida Keys, USA. We found pre-capture depredation rates were highly variable amongst habitat types, ranging from zero on shallow water flats, to 35.3% and 90.1% on specific reef and shipwreck locations, respectively. Observed predators were all large sharks. Importantly, one of the high predation sites is an important permit spawning location, thus C&R fishing in that locale may be a conservation concern. Physiological stress responses (blood lactate, glucose, pH) and reflex tests indicated that permit were relatively robust to routine angling (fight durations of 1 to 12 min) and handling (air exposure up to 2 min). Short duration post-release tracking using tri-axial acceleration biologgers identified no differences in swimming activity for fish that were kept in water versus those held in the air for 2 min to simulate an admiration period. While this study indicates that permit are relatively robust to C&R angling in terms of stress responses and behavioural impairment, high densities of opportunistic predators at certain fishing locations can result in high rates of pre-capture depredation independent of the state of the animal. Permit angling in locations with high predator densities is a potential conservation issue, especially if specific locations represent important pre-spawning aggregation sites for fish populations that may be more vulnerable to predation and thus depredation. Current C&R best practices (i.e., limiting fight times and air exposure) may not be adequate to ensure permit survival at high predator density sites. Angling-related depredation is often cryptic, yet is a growing conservation concern in many fisheries – we developed and applied a novel framework for identifying cryptic depredation that may be applicable across fisheries.},

   abstract = {Data-limited fisheries are a major challenge for stock assessment analysts, as many traditional data-rich models cannot be implemented. Approaches based on stock reduction analysis offer simple ways to handle low data availability, but are particularly sensitive to assumptions on relative stock status (i.e., current biomass compared to unperturbed biomass). For the vast majority of data-limited stocks, stock status is unmeasured. The present study presents a method to elicit expert knowledge to inform stock status and a novel, user-friendly on-line application for expert elicitation. Expert opinions are compared to stock status derived from data-rich models. Here, it is evaluated how experts with different levels of experience in stock assessment performed relative to each other and with different qualities of data. Both “true” stock status and expert experience level were identified as significant factors accounting for the error in stock status elicitation. Relative stock status was the main driver of imprecision in the stock status prior (e.g., lower stock status had more imprecision in elicited stock status). Data availability and life-history information were not identified to be significant variables explaining imprecision in elicited stock status. All experts, regardless of their experience level, appeared to be risk neutral in the central tendency of stock status. Given the sensitivity to stock status misspecification for some popular data-limited methods, stock status can be usefully elicited from experts, but expert subjectivity and experience should be taken under consideration when applying those values.},

   abstract = {As global research into recreational fishing gains momentum due to the pursuit's biological, social and economic impacts, information on regional and temporal patterns of recreational exploitation will continue to enable objective assessment and development of management initiatives for exploited species. This paper demonstrates the utility of offsite survey methods in assessing spatial and temporal differences in recorded catches from a large, diffuse and heterogenous coastal recreational fishery. Using the estuarine recreational fishery that operates along the coast of New South Wales, Australia as a case study, survey data was employed to quantify annual (June 2013-May 2014) state-wide estuarine catch. Generalized linear mixed effects models were then applied to expanded catch estimates from surveyed households to examine the influence of zone and season on the kept and released numbers of snapper (Pagrus auratus), dusky flathead (Platycephalus fuscus) and bream (Acanthopagrus spp. complex comprised of A. butcheri, A. australis and their hybrids). For kept bream, significant differential seasonal effects were observed in all regions except the Mid-South Coast. For released bream, numbers were greatest in Sydney and during Summer and Winter. For kept snapper, the greatest harvest was recorded in the Mid-South Coast but season had no effect. Differential seasonal effects were found in each zone for released snapper. For kept dusky flathead, the greatest numbers were recorded in Sydney and the Mid-South Coast but season had no effect. We conclude by assessing some current spatial and temporal management initiatives in light of the uncovered patterns of recreational catch and consider the implications of these patterns in terms of future ecosystem-based management recommendations aimed at achieving ecological, social and economic sustainability in fisheries.},

   abstract = {Generalized additive models (GAMs) were applied to examine the relative influence of various factors on fishery performance, defined as nominal catch-per-unit-effort (CPUE) of swordfish (Xiphias gladius) and blue shark (Prionace glauca) in the Hawaii-based swordfish fishery. Commercial fisheries data for the analysis consisted of a 5 year (1991-1995) time series of 27 901 longline sets. Mesoscale relationships were analysed for seven physical variables (latitude, longitude, SST, SST frontal energy, temporal changes in SST (ΔSST), SST frontal energy (ΔSST frontal energy) and bathymetry), all of which may affect the availability of swordfish and blue shark to the fishery, and three variables (number of lightsticks per hook, lunar index, and wind velocity) which may relate to the effectiveness of the fishing gear. Longline CPUE data were analysed in relation to SST data on three spatiotemporal scales (18 km weekly, 1°-weekly, 1°-monthly). Depending on the scale of SST data, GAM analysis accounted for 39-42% and 44-45% of the variance in nominal CPUE for swordfish and blue shark, respectively. Stepwise GAM building revealed the relative importance of the variables in explaining the variance in CPUE. For swordfish, by decreasing importance, the variables ranked: (1) latitude, (2) time, (3) longitude, (4) lunar index, (5) lightsticks per hook, (6) SST, (7) ΔSST frontal energy, (8) wind velocity, (9) SST frontal energy, (10) bathymetry, and (11) ΔSST. For blue shark, the variables ranked: (1) latitude, (2) longitude, (3) time, (4) SST, (5) lightsticks per hook, (6) ΔSST, (7) ΔSST frontal energy, (8) SST frontal energy, (9) wind velocity, (10) lunar index, and (11) bathymetry. Swordfish CPUE increased with latitude to peak at 35-40°N and increased in the vicinity of temperature fronts and during the full moon. Shark CPUE also increased with latitude up to 40°N, and increased westward, but declined abruptly at SSTs colder than 16°C. As a comparison with modelling fishery performance in relation to specific environmental and fishery operational effects, fishery performance was also modelled as a function of categorical time (month) and area (2°squares) variables using a generalized linear model (GLM) approach. The variance accounted for by the GLMs was ≃ 1-3% lower than the variance explained by the GAMs. Time series of swordfish and blue shark CPUE standardized for the environmental and operational variables quantified in the GAM and for the time-area effects in the GLM are presented. For swordfish, both nominal and standardized time series indicate a decline in CPUE, whereas the opposite trend was seen for blue shark.},

   abstract = {In northern industrialized countries, the inland fisheries sector has long been dominated by recreational fisheries, which normally exploit fish for leisure or subsistence and provide many (poorly investigated) benefits to society. Various factors constrain the development and existence of inland fisheries, such as local user conflicts, low social priority and inadequate research and funding. In many cases, however, degradation of the environment and loss of aquatic habitat are the predominant concerns for the sustainability of inland fisheries. The need for concerted effort to prevent and reduce environmental degradation, as well as conservation of freshwater fish and fisheries as renewable common pool resources or entities in their own right is the greatest challenge facing sustainable development of inland waters. In inland fisheries management, the declining quality of the aquatic environment coupled with long-term inadequate and often inappropriate fisheries management has led to an emphasis on enhancement practices, such as stocking, to mitigate anthropogenic stress. However, this is not always the most appropriate management approach. Therefore, there is an urgent need to alter many traditional inland fisheries management practices and systems to focus on sustainable development. This paper reviews the literature regarding the inputs needed for sustainability of inland fisheries in industrialized countries. To understand better the problems facing sustainable inland fisheries management, the inland fisheries environment, its benefits, negative impacts and constraints, as well as historical management, paradigms, trends and current practices are described. Major philosophical shifts, challenges and promising integrated management approaches are envisaged in a holistic framework. The following are considered key elements for sustainable development of inland fisheries: communication, information dissemination, education, institutional restructuring, marketing outreach, management plans, decision analysis, socioeconomic evaluation and research into the human dimension, in addition to traditional biological and ecological sciences. If these inputs are integrated with traditional fisheries management practices, the prospects for sustainability in the inland fisheries will be enhanced.},

   abstract = {Preface The Project This project was undertaken to advance best practices for addressing the impact of science and management uncertainty on fisheries management systems. The project engaged a panel of experts (the Panel) and the work was facilitated through the examination of a series of case studies. The project used structured approaches to assessing how uncertainty is evaluated, reduced, and managed for in fisheries science and management. The Panel focused on science and management approaches separately, but also probed the implications of work that takes place at the interface of these two fields. The National Aquarium convened three workshops from January through June 2014 in which the Panel considered various issues surrounding uncertainty in fisheries science and management, refined the focus of this project, and evaluated current approaches to uncertainty. At these meetings, Panel members gained first-hand knowledge from Council members and scientists. The Panel reviewed approaches being used to evaluate, reduce, manage for and communicate uncertainty in fisheries around the world. The Panel also explored innovative approaches that could be developed to be consistent with the current legislative and regulatory framework for U.S. fisheries management. Each workshop concluded with deliberations about critical issues. The Panel identified relevant fisheries case studies, reviewed the current state of uncertainty consideration and discussed approaches to bridge the science/management continuum. Based on these deliberations and through consideration of specific fishery examples, the Panel developed its findings and recommendations.},

   abstract = {Catch-and-release recreational angling has become very popular as a conservation strategy and as a fisheries management tool for a diverse array of fishes. Implicit in catch-and-release angling strategies is the assumption that fish experience low mortality and minimal sub-lethal effects. Despite the importance of this premise, research on this topic has focused on several popular North American sportfish, with negligible efforts directed towards understanding catch-and-release angling effects on alternative fish species. Here, we summarise the existing literature to develop five general trends that could be adopted for species for which no data are currently available: (1) minimise angling duration, (2) minimise air exposure, (3) avoid angling during extremes in water temperature, (4) use barbless hooks and artificial lures/flies, and (5) refrain from angling fish during the reproductive period. These generalities provide some level of protection to all species, but do have limitations. Therefore, we argue that a goal of conservation science and fisheries management should be the creation of species-specific guidelines for catch-and-release. These guidelines would take into account the inter-specific diversity of fishes and variation in fishing techniques. As recreational angling continues to grow in popularity, expanding to many developing countries, and targeting alternative species, it is important that reasonable data appropriate for specific fish and fisheries are available. The sustainable use and conservation of recreational fishery resources will depend upon the development and dissemination of effective catch-and-release angling strategies based upon sound science to stakeholders around the world. © Springer 2005.},

   abstract = {Catch-and-release angling is a well-established practice in recreational angler behaviour and fisheries management. Accompanying this is a growing body of catch-and-release research that can be applied to reduce injury, mortality and sublethal alterations in behaviour and physiology. Here, the status of catch-and-release research from a symposium on the topic is summarised. Several general themes emerged including the need to: (1) better connect sublethal assessments to population-level processes; (2) enhance understanding of the variation in fish, fishing practices and gear and their role in catch and release; (3) better understand animal welfare issues related to catch and release; (4) increase the exchange of information on fishing-induced stress, injury and mortality between the recreational and commercial fishing sectors; and (5) improve procedures for measuring and understanding the effect of catch-and-release angling. Through design of better catch-and-release studies, strategies could be developed to further minimise stress, injury and mortality arising from catch-and-release angling. These strategies, when integrated with other fish population and fishery characteristics, can be used by anglers and managers to sustain or enhance recreational fishing resources. © 2007 The Authors.

Simulated catch-and-release fishing included combinations of depth of capture and ther-mocline exposure reflective of environmental conditions experienced in the Gulf of Mexico. Frequency of occurrence of barotrauma and lack of reflex response exhibited considerable individual variation. When combined into a single condition or impairment index, individual variation was reduced, and impairment showed significant increases as depth increased and with the addition of thermo-cline exposure. Performance variables, such as burst swimming speed (BSS) and simulated predator approach distance (AD), were also significantly different by depth. BSSs and predator ADs decreased with increasing depth, were lowest immediately after release, and were affected for up to 15 min, with longer recovery times required as depth increased. The impairment score developed was positively correlated with cortisol concentration and negatively correlated with both BSS and simulated predator AD. The impairment index proved to be an efficient method to estimate the overall impairment of red snapper in the laboratory simulations of capture and shows promise for use in field conditions, to estimate release mortality and vulnerability to predation. © 2009 International Council for the Exploration of the Sea.},

   abstract = {There is some uncertainty in the fisheries sciencepolicy interface. Although progress has been made towards more transparency and participation in fisheries science in ICES Areas, routine use of state-of-the-art quantitative and qualitative tools to address uncertainty systematically is still lacking. Fisheries science that gives advice to policy-making is plagued by uncertainties; the stakes of the policies are high and value-laden and need therefore to be treated as an example of "post-normal science" (PNS). To achieve robust governance, understanding of the characteristics and implications of the scientific uncertainties for management strategies need to come to the centre of the table. This can be achieved using state-of-the-art tools such as pedigree matrices and uncertainty matrices, as developed by PNS scholars and used in similar sciencepolicy arenas on other complex issues. An explicit extension of the peer community within maritime systems will be required to put these new tools in place.

Management of the Dusky Shark Carcharhinus obscurus in the northwest Atlantic Ocean has been particularly challenging due to the species’ inherent vulnerability to overfishing and poorly understood habitat associations. To better understand habitat associations and seasonal distributions, we combined telemetry and remotely sensed environmental data to spatially model juvenile Dusky Shark presence probability in the northwest Atlantic Ocean. To accomplish this, 22 juvenile Dusky Sharks (107–220 cm TL) that were tagged with acoustic transmitters at different locations within the U.S. Middle Atlantic Bight region were tracked through networked arrays of acoustic receivers. Tag detections were summarized as daily presence records, and data describing environmental conditions, including depth, chlorophyll-a concentration, salinity, and sea surface temperature, were extracted at detection locations. These data were used in boosted regression tree models to predict juvenile Dusky Shark presence probability based on environmental parameters during fall 2017 and summer 2018. Telemetry observations and modeled presence probability showed consistent associations with temperatures between 16°C and 26°C and chlorophyll-a concentrations between 2 and 7 mg/m3, which were associated with seasonal migration timing and monthly spatial distributions. Dusky Shark tag detections and predicted distributions during summer and early fall overlapped areas in the Middle Atlantic Bight that were affected by fisheries and potential offshore energy development. Our methodology provides a framework for assessing climate change effects on distribution.},

Many benefits result from working together, including (1) the incorporation of fishers’ knowledge and expertise into the management process and (2) the development of shared perspectives derived through science-based investigations on the status of marine resources. The California Collaborative Fisheries Research Program was formed in 2006 to participate in the monitoring of marine reserves established through California’s Marine Life Protection Act.

Yelloweye rockfish (Sebastes ruberrimus), canary rockfish (S. pinniger) and bocaccio (S. paucispinis) in the inland waterways of Puget Sound (PS), WA, USA were listed under the U.S. Endangered Species Act (ESA) in 2010. These listings relied heavily on evidence from other species that these populations were ‘discrete’ taxonomic units because little information was available for these species in PS. To fill this data gap, we collaborated with recreational fishing communities in PS to collect tissue samples and used population genetics analyses to determine whether samples from PS were genetically differentiated from samples collected from the outer coasts of the U.S. and Canada. Multiple analyses using restriction-site associated DNA sequencing data showed that yelloweye rockfish in PS and British Columbia, Canada were genetically different from coastal populations, while canary rockfish showed no genetic differentiation. These results support hypotheses that the genetic connectivity of rockfish populations is based on interactions between life-history characteristics and oceanographic conditions. These data also support the ESA designation status and the expansion of protected geographical boundaries for yelloweye rockfish but also suggest canary rockfish in PS are not a ‘discrete’ population and may not meet the first criterion of the ESA, as initially assumed. Collaboration among agencies and fishing communities, and cost-efficient genetic analyses provided a framework for collecting and analyzing data essential to the conservation and management of threatened and endangered species.},

   abstract = {Understanding the efficacy of marine protected areas (MPAs) for wide-ranging predators is essential to designing effective management and conservation approaches. The use of acoustic monitoring and network analysis can improve our understanding of the spatial ecology and functional connectivity of reef-associated species, providing a useful approach for reef-based conservation planning. This study compared and contrasted the movement and connectivity of sharks with different degrees of reef association. We examined the residency, dispersal, degree of reef connectivity, and MPA use of grey reef (Carcharhinus amblyrhynchos), silvertip (C. albimarginatus), and bull (C. leucas) sharks monitored in the central Great Barrier Reef (GBR). An array of 56 acoustic receivers was used to monitor shark movements on 17 semi-isolated reefs. Carcharhinus amblyrhynchos and C. albimarginatus were detected most days at or near their tagging reef. However, while C. amblyrhynchos spent 80% of monitoring days in the array, C. albimarginatus was only detected 50% of the time. Despite both species moving similar distances (,50 km), a large portion of the population of C. albimarginatus (71%) was detected on multiple reefs and moved more frequently between reefs and management zones than C. amblyrhynchos. Carcharhinus leucas was detected less than 20% of the time within the tagging array, and 42% of the population undertook long-range migrations to other arrays in the GBR. Networks derived for C. leucas were larger and more complex than those for C. amblyrhynchos and C. albimarginatus. Our findings suggest that protecting specific reefs based on prior knowledge (e.g., healthier reefs with high fish biomass) and increasing the level of protection to include nearby, closely spaced reef habitats (,20 km) may perform better for species like C. albimarginatus than having either a single or a network of isolated MPAs. This design would also provide protection for larger male C. amblyrhynchos, which tend to disperse more and use larger areas than females. For wide-ranging sharks like C. leucas, a combination of spatial planning and other alternative measures is critical. Our findings demonstrate that acoustic monitoring can serve as a useful platform for designing more effective MPA networks for reef predators displaying a range of movement patterns.},

   abstract = {Modeling animal movements is fundamental to animal ecology as it provides the foundation for further exploration into mechanisms affecting individual and population-level processes. In the last few decades, biotelemetry has enabled scientists to track the movements of marine life across a variety of scales. However, the use of such technology is progressing faster than the analytical techniques for modeling movement patterns. In summer 2012, we deployed an acoustic telemetry array around Culebra, Puerto Rico, consisting of 48 remote receivers that can detect coded transmissions sent by tags implanted in fish. We surgically implanted transmitters in bonefish ( n= 28), great barracuda ( n= 2) and permit ( n= 1) as part of a multi-year study. In January 2013, we downloaded over 850,000 detections from 39 receivers for 31 fish (several receivers had zero fish detections, and two receivers were not downloaded), and used that six-month data set to explore how graph theory and network analysis can be used to model the movement ecology of the tagged fish. We analyzed this data as two types of graphs. First, a bipartite graph was constructed by linking each fish with an edge weighted by the number of detections of that fish by that receiver. Bipartite graphs are not explicitly spatial, but rather represent which fish associate with which receivers. Second, spatial movement graphs for individuals were built by linking receivers (nodes) by edges with the number of times each fish moved along that edge as weights. The bipartite graph identified groups of fish visiting the same sites, and groups of sites visited by the same fish. Of the six community detection algorithms used, Multilevel, Fast-Greedy, and Walk-Trap performed best, with similar module partitions and modularity scores. All three of these algorithms produced modules (groups) that appear to reflect working hypotheses related to the coastal bathymetry, habitat types, and associated movement ecology of the tagged species. Spatial movement graphs were very different for each fish examined and reflect behavioral differences. Fish exhibited various movement patterns, some showing the pattern of a central place forager (bonefish), while others cruised along a territory (great barracuda and permit).},

For telemetry-derived knowledge to be relevant to managers and policy makers, the research approach must consider management information needs for decision-making, while end users require an understanding of telemetry technology (capabilities and limitations), its application to fisheries research and monitoring (study design), and proper interpretation of results and conclusions (considering the potential for biases and proper recognition of associated uncertainties). To help bridge this gap, we provide a set of considerations and a checklist for researchers to guide them in conducting reliable and management-relevant telemetry studies, and for managers to evaluate the reliability and relevance of telemetry studies so as to better integrate findings into management plans.

   abstract = {Many shark species exhibit complex spatial ecology throughout their life histories, posing a challenge for conservation and management. Although most marine protected areas (MPAs) were originally established to protect less mobile organisms, protection of shark species from fishing and other impacts is possible if individuals exhibit high residency and site fidelity within the MPA boundaries. For this study, we used a fixed acoustic telemetry array to study the residency, habitat use, and interspecific space use among 4 shark species in Buck Island Reef National Monument (BIRNM), an MPA in St. Croix, US Virgin Islands. From June 2013 to May 2017, 11 nurse sharks Ginglymostoma cirratum, 6 lemon sharks Negaprion brevirostris, 13 Caribbean reef sharks Carcharhinus perezi, and 6 tiger sharks Galeocerdo cuvier were monitored in the array. Overall, residency was high for all species, with a mean residency index of 0.52 or higher for each species. Network analysis revealed complex inter- and intraspecific spatial associations among individuals. Community detection algorithms showed that G. cirratum and N. brevirostris frequently used the same areas in BIRNM, selecting for shallow sand and seagrass habitats near linear reefs, while G. cuvier and C. perezi had more individualized space use. C. perezi also exhibited ontogenetic shifts, developing individual territories and using deeper water with increasing body size. This work emphasizes the importance of MPA size, placement, and habitat composition when aiming to protect highly mobile species with potentially large home ranges and shifting space use throughout their life histories.},

   abstract = {The Ocean Tracking Network (OTN) Canada is an integrative seven-year research program initiated in 2010 with academic, government, and industry partners. The team makes use of novel biotelemetry (primarily acoustic telemetry curtains), biologging, and oceanographic technologies to better understand changing ocean dynamics and their impact on ocean ecosystems, animal movements, and ecology and the dynamics of marine animal populations, many of which are commercially important. The network is organized around three ocean arenas (i.e., the Atlantic, Arctic, and Pacific) where specific research projects will occur. However, all projects will contribute toward addressing a single unifying national scale question-what are the movements of continental shelf marine animals, how do these movements affect species interactions, and what are the consequences of environmental variability/change and human activities on these species' distributions and abundance? Taxa that will be tracked include diadromous (e.g., salmon, eels, sturgeon) and marine (e.g., sharks, capelin, cod) fishes and a variety of marine mammals (e.g., grey seals, killer whales). Some of the common activities that occur in all arenas include measurements of oceanographic characteristics and variability at various spatial and temporal scales, movements of key species at several trophic levels, and use of key acoustic "bioprobes" (animals that carry tags that record locations visited, ocean conditions, and interactions with other tagged animals) and "roboprobes" (remotely controlled autonomous vehicles such as gliders that measure physical, biological, and chemical conditions) to complement measurements from fixed OTN acoustic telemetry curtains. Ultimately, scientific information generated will inform resource management, help formulate new socioeconomic policies, and provide some impetus to the reformulation of governance practices and legal standards.},

To understand the occurrence of false detections in acoustic monitoring data sets, the results of a range test experiment using eight acoustic receivers and 12 transmitters were examined. Results: One hundred and fifty one tag ID codes were recorded, 137 of which were identified as likely from false detections, 12 were from test tags, and two were from tagged sharks. False detections accounted for <0.05 % of detections (918) in the experiment. False detection tag ID codes were not randomly distributed amongst the available codes, being more likely to occur at IDs close to tags used in the experiment. Receivers located near the bottom recorded the most false detections and tag ID codes from false detections. Receivers at the same depth did not differ significantly in the mean number of daily false detections. The daily number of false detections recorded by a receiver did not conform to a random pattern, and was not strongly correlated with daily receiver performance. Conclusions: In an era of increasing data sharing and public storage of scientific data, the occurrence of false detections is of significant concern and the results of this study demonstrate that while rare they do occur and can be identified and accounted for in analyses.},

   abstract = {We used acoustic telemetry to quantify permit Trachinotus falcatus habitat use and connectivity in proximity to the Florida Keys, USA, and assessed these patterns relative to current habitat and fisheries management practices. From March 2017 to June 2018, 45 permit tagged within 16 km of the lower Florida Keys were detected at stationary acoustic receivers throughout the south Florida region, the majority of which remained within the Special Permit Zone, where more extensive fisheries harvest regulations are implemented. There was a high level of connectivity between nearshore flats (i.e., <3 m water depth) and the Florida reef tract (FRT; 15–40 m water depth), with 75% of individuals detected in both habitats. These locations probably function primarily as foraging and spawning habitats, respectively. Permit occupancy on the FRT peaked during the months of March–September, with the highest number of individuals occurring there in April and May. Specific sites on the FRT were identified as potentially important spawning locations, as they attracted a high proportion of individuals that exhibited frequent visits with high residency durations. There were also significant positive relationships between seasonal habitat-use metrics on the FRT and an empirical permit gonadosomatic index. Large aggregations of permit at spawning sites on the FRT are potentially vulnerable to the effects of fishing (including predation during catch and release) at a critical point in their life cycle. These data on permit space use and movement, coupled with knowledge of stressors on their ecology, provide insights for implementing science-based strategic management plans.},

   abstract = { Marine fish movement plays a critical role in ecosystem functioning and is increasingly studied with acoustic telemetry. Traditionally, this research has focused on single species and small spatial scales. However, integrated tracking networks, such as the Integrated Tracking of Aquatic Animals in the Gulf of Mexico (iTAG) network, are building the capacity to monitor multiple species over larger spatial scales. We conducted a synthesis of passive acoustic monitoring data for 29 species (889 transmitters), ranging from large top predators to small consumers, monitored along the west coast of Florida, USA, over 3 yr (2016-2018). Space use was highly variable, with some groups using all monitored areas and others using only the area where they were tagged. The most extensive space use was found for Atlantic tarpon Megalops atlanticus and bull sharks Carcharhinus leucas . Individual detection patterns clustered into 4 groups, ranging from occasionally detected long-distance movers to frequently detected juvenile or adult residents. Synchronized, alongshore, long-distance movements were found for Atlantic tarpon, cobia Rachycentron canadum , and several elasmobranch species. These movements were predominantly northbound in spring and southbound in fall. Detections of top predators were highest in summer, except for nearshore Tampa Bay where the most detections occurred in fall, coinciding with large red drum Sciaenops ocellatus spawning aggregations. We discuss the future of collaborative telemetry research, including current limitations and potential solutions to maximize its impact for understanding movement ecology, conducting ecosystem monitoring, and supporting fisheries management. },

   abstract = {Background: The use of internal telemetry has greatly advanced fisheries research in the past two decades, permitting researchers to observe movements and distributions of organisms in their natural environment. For many years, the prevailing opinion has been that internal tags should not weigh more than 2% of the dry body weight of a fish. Some studies indicate that tags weighing up to 12% dry body weight do not have a negative effect on swimming performance, but few authors have examined impacts to fish physiology and health. This study investigated how tags greater than 2% body mass affected the mortality, tag retention, swimming performance, and physiological indicators of stress in brook trout (Salvelinus fontinalis Mitchill). Results: No mortality was observed between treatment groups, but tag retention was lowest in the heavy tag treatment group in which 80% (12 fish) lost tags. Swimming performance and physiological indices of stress were not significantly impacted by tag mass. Fish tagged with heavy tags showed slower growth in the 3weeks after tagging, but growth rates appeared to recover by the end of the study, although this result may be confounded by tag loss. Conclusion: The results of this study suggest that for brook trout, the 2% rule is a highly conservative guideline that can be substantially extended but should not exceed 7% body weight due to concerns about tag retention.},

However, only recently have researchers begun using electronic tags to elucidate the processes that relate directly to fitness, i.e. the ability of organisms to survive and reproduce. We briefly review the history of tracking studies focused on marine vertebrates and then provide a general overview of studies that have used tracking to address fitnessrelated questions. Although many studies have used at-sea movement and activity data to better understand feeding ecology, physio logy, and energetics, there is growing interest in the coupling of electronic tracking techniques with other disciplines to resolve the mechanisms underlying individual fitness, or more precisely the proxies thereof (survival, timing of reproduction, foraging success, etc.). We categorized studies into 4 general fitness-related areas: (1) foraging dynamics, energetics, and growth; (2) migration and other non-breeding season activities; (3) survival; and (4) reproduction. Despite recent advances in tracking technologies, which include multi-sensor loggers, tri-axial accelerometers, and miniaturized geo positioning systems, etc., very few studies on wild marine vertebrates truly measure individual fitness or proxies thereof. There is thus a need to design experimental, multi-disciplinary, and longitudinal studies that use genetics, individual-based modeling, and other techniques in an effort to resolve the mechanisms responsible for individual variation in fitness in marine vertebrates. © Inter-Research 2014.},

   abstract = {Spawning site selection and reproductive timing affect stock productivity and structure in marine fishes but are poorly understood. Traditionally, stock assessments measure reproductive potential as spawning stock biomass or egg production and do not include other aspects of reproductive behavior. Red drum make an excellent case study to assess these other aspects, as (1) they are highly fecund, pelagic spawners, like most exploited marine fishes; (2) their life cycle is delineated between nursery (estuarine) and adult (coastal and offshore) habitat; and (3) they are managed at these two spatial scales. This study was conducted from August 2012 to December 2013 and integrates data from multiple methods and spatial scales. Aerial surveys were used for large-scale monitoring of aggregations off two known estuarine nursery areas, Tampa Bay and Charlotte Harbor, Florida, USA. Capture-based sampling in Tampa Bay coastal (n = 2581) and estuarine waters (n = 158) was used to assess reproductive state and to confirm coastal spawning. To assess spatial dynamics, we acoustically tagged two population components in the Tampa Bay system, subadults from the estuary (n = 20) and adults from the coastal spawning site (n = 60). Behavioral plasticity was seen in subadult recruitment to coastal habitat, with some subadults maturing and recruiting before or during the spawning season and others (14 of 20 acoustically tagged fish) recruiting at the end of the 2012 spawning season. Both adults and recruited subadults (n = 29) were consequently detected in the Charlotte Harbor array, 132 km to the south. Spawning-site fidelity to the Tampa Bay spawning site occurred at both the population and individual scales. Aggregations consistently occurred in Tampa Bay coastal waters during the spawning season, and approximately two-thirds of tagged adults returned in the 2013 spawning season. A similar proportion of subadults returned to the Tampa Bay spawning site, exhibiting natal homing. However, these first-time spawners arrived later than repeat spawners and were detected over shorter time periods. This study, and others like it, demonstrates how integrating data from individuals tracked over space and time with more traditional population-based sampling is changing our understanding of ecological processes that affect marine fish productivity and our ability to manage for sustainablity.},

   abstract = {A close relationship between adult abundance and stock productivity may not exist for many marine fish stocks, resulting in concern that the management goal of maximum sustainable yield is either inefficient or risky. Although reproductive success is tightly coupled with adult abundance and fecundity in many terrestrial animals, in exploited marine fish where and when fish spawn and consequent dispersal dynamics may have a greater impact. Here, we propose an eco-evolutionary perspective, reproductive resilience, to understand connectivity and productivity in marine fish. Reproductive resilience is the capacity of a population to maintain the reproductive success needed to result in long-term population stability despite disturbances. A stock's reproductive resilience is driven by the underlying traits in its spawner-recruit system, selected for over evolutionary timescales, and the ecological context within which it is operating. Spawner-recruit systems are species specific, have both density-dependent and fitness feedback loops and are made up of fixed, behavioural and ecologically variable traits. They operate over multiple temporal, spatial and biological scales, with trait diversity affecting reproductive resilience at both the population and individual (i.e. portfolio) scales. Models of spawner-recruit systems fall within three categories: (i) two-dimensional models (i.e. spawner and recruit); (ii) process-based biophysical dispersal models which integrate physical and environmental processes into understanding recruitment; and (iii) complex spatially explicit integrated life cycle models. We review these models and their underlying assumptions about reproductive success vs. our emerging mechanistic understanding. We conclude with practical guidelines for integrating reproductive resilience into assessments of population connectivity and stock productivity.},

They enable researchers to document, for long uninterrupted periods, how undisturbed organisms interact with each other and their environment in real time. In spite of advances enabling the monitoring of many physiological and behavioural variables across a range of taxa of various sizes, these devices have yet to be embraced widely by the ecological community. Our review suggests that this technology has immense potential for research in basic and applied animal ecology. Efforts to incorporate biotelemetry into broader ecological research programs should yield novel information that has been challenging to collect historically from free-ranging animals in their natural environments.

   abstract = {The function of species has been recognized as critical for the maintenance of ecosystems within desired states. However, there are still considerable gaps in our knowledge of interspecific differences in the functional roles of organisms, particularly with regard to the spatial scales over which functional impact is exerted. This has implications for the delivery of function and the maintenance of ecosystem processes. In this study we assessed the allometric relationship between foraging movements and fish body length at three sites, for 20 species of herbivorous reef fishes within four different functional groups: browsers, farmers, grazer/ detritivores, and scraper/excavators. The relationship between vulnerability of species to fishing and their scale of foraging was also examined. We present empirical evidence of the strong, positive, log-linear relationship between the scale of foraging movement and fish body length. This relationship was consistent among sites and between the two different movement metrics used. Phylogeny did not affect these results. Functional groups foraged over contrasting ranges of spatial scales; for example, scraper/excavators performed their role over a wide range of scales, whereas browsers were represented by few species and operated over a narrow range of scales. Overfishing is likely not only to remove species operating at large scales, but also to remove the browser group as a whole. Large fishes typically have a significant role in removing algae on reefs, and browsers are key to controlling macroalgae and reversing shifts to macroalgal-dominated states. This vulnerability to exploitation has serious consequences for the ability of fish assemblages to deliver their functional role in the face of anthropogenic impacts. However, identification of the scales at which herbivorous fish assemblages are susceptible to fishing provides managers with critical knowledge to design management strategies to support coral-dominated reefs by maintaining function at the spatial scales at which vulnerable species operate. © 2013 by the Ecological Society of America.},

   abstract = {As habitat loss and fragmentation increase across ungulate ranges, identifying and prioritizing migration routes for conservation has taken on new urgency. Here we present a general framework using the Brownian bridge movement model (BBMM) that: (1) provides a probabilistic estimate of the migration routes of a sampled population, (2) distinguishes between route segments that function as stopover sites vs. those used primarily as movement corridors, and (3) prioritizes routes for conservation based upon the proportion of the sampled population that uses them. We applied this approach to a migratory mule deer (Odocoileus hemionus) population in a pristine area of southwest Wyoming, USA, where 2000 gas wells and 1609 km of pipelines and roads have been proposed for development. Our analysis clearly delineated where migration routes occurred relative to proposed development and provided guidance for on-the-ground conservation efforts. Mule deer migration routes were characterized by a series of stopover sites where deer spent most of their time, connected by movement corridors through which deer moved quickly. Our findings suggest management strategies that differentiate between stopover sites and movement corridors may be warranted. Because some migration routes were used by more mule deer than others, proportional level of use may provide a reasonable metric by which routes can be prioritized for conservation. The methods we outline should be applicable to a wide range of species that inhabit regions where migration routes are threatened or poorly understood. © 2009 by the Ecological Society of America.},

   abstract = {We document the distribution and abundance of seagrasses, as well as the intra-annual temporal patterns in the abundance of seagrasses and the productivity of the nearshore dominant seagrass (Thalassia testudinum) in the south Florida region. At least one species of seagrass was present at 80.8% of 874 randomly chosen mapping sites, delimiting 12,800 km2 of seagrass beds in the 17,000-km2 survey area. Halophila decipiens had the greatest range in the study area; it was found to occur over 7,500 km2. The range of T. testudinum was almost as extensive (6,400 km2), followed by Syringodium filiforme (4,400 km2), Halodule wrightii (3,000 km2) and Halophila engelmanni (50 km2). The seasonal maxima of standing crop was about 32% higher than the yearly mean. The productivity of T. testudinum was both temporally and spatially variable. Yearly mean areal productivity averaged 0.70 g m-2day-1 with a range of 0.05-3.29 g m-2 day-1. Specific productivity ranged between 3.2 and 34.2 mg g-1 day-1, with a mean of 18.3 mg g-1 day-1. Annual peaks in specific productivity occurred in August, and minima in February. Integrating the standing crop for the study area gives an estimate of 1.4 × 1011 g T. testudinum and 3.6 × 1010 g S. filiforme, which translate to a yearly production of 9.4 × 1011 g T. testudinum leaves and 2.4 × 1011 g S. filiforme leaves. We assessed the efficacy of rapid visual surveys for estimating abundance of seagrasses in south Florida by comparing these results to measures of leaf biomass for T. testudinum and S. filiforme. Our rapid visual surveys proved useful for quantifying seagrass abundance, and the data presented in this paper serve as a benchmark against which future change in the system can be quantified.},

   abstract = {When wildlife habitat overlaps with industrial development animals may be harmed. Because wildlife and people select resources to maximize biological fitness and economic return, respectively, we estimated risk, the probability of eagles encountering and being affected by turbines, by overlaying models of resource selection for each entity. This conceptual framework can be applied across multiple spatial scales to understand and mitigate impacts of industry on wildlife. We estimated risk to Golden Eagles (Aquila chrysaetos) from wind energy development in 3 topographically distinct regions of the central Appalachian Mountains of Pennsylvania (United States) based on models of resource selection of wind facilities (n = 43) and of northbound migrating eagles (n = 30). Risk to eagles from wind energy was greatest in the Ridge and Valley region; all 24 eagles that passed through that region used the highest risk landscapes at least once during low altitude flight. In contrast, only half of the birds that entered the Allegheny Plateau region used highest risk landscapes and none did in the Allegheny Mountains. Likewise, in the Allegheny Mountains, the majority of wind turbines (56%) were situated in poor eagle habitat; thus, risk to eagles is lower there than in the Ridge and Valley, where only 1% of turbines are in poor eagle habitat. Risk within individual facilities was extremely variable; on average, facilities had 11% (SD 23; range = 0-100%) of turbines in highest risk landscapes and 26% (SD 30; range = 0-85%) of turbines in the lowest risk landscapes. Our results provide a mechanism for relocating high-risk turbines, and they show the feasibility of this novel and highly adaptable framework for managing risk of harm to wildlife from industrial development. © 2014 Society for Conservation Biology.},

   abstract = {Permit, Trachinotus falcatus are economically and ecologically important throughout their range of the Caribbean, subtropical and tropical western Atlantic, and Gulf of Mexico. Despite their economic importance, little is known about the biology and ecology of permit, and most existing information is from Florida. While sufficient information is available to paint a general picture of permit life history, details are lacking for most life stages. For the juvenile life stage, nursery habitats and size and age at settlement have not yet been defined. Although six distinct habitat types (medium energy and low energy windward beaches, leeward beaches, and windward, leeward, and lagoon interior mangrove shorelines) were sampled to determine spatial patterns of habitat use by early juvenile permit at Turneffe Atoll, Belize, Central America, and the Florida Keys, USA, 99% of juvenile permit were found along medium energy windward beaches, indicating their role as nursery habitat for this species. A sub-sample of juvenile permit from Florida was examined to estimate spawning date and age at settlement from otoliths. Size-frequency distributions and otolith age analysis indicate that larval duration is approximately 15 - 20 days, and settlement occurs year-round. Since permit in Florida spawn March through July, from March through September in Cuba, and from February through October in Belize, year-round settlement indicates population connectivity via larval transport. These results lay the foundation for future research on larval supply, population connectivity, and juvenile ecology, and will aid in the ongoing formulation of a conservation plan toward a sustainable fishery for permit. © Springer 2006.},

   abstract = {The use of animal-born sensors for location-based tracking and bio-logging in terrestrial systems has expanded dramatically in the past 10 years. This rapid expansion has generated new data on how animals interact with and respond to variation in their environment, resulting in important ecological, physiological, and evolutionary insights. Although understanding the finer details of animal locations has important management relevance, applied studies are not prominent in the movement ecology literature. This is despite the long history of applied studies of animal movement and the urgent and growing need for evidence-based conservation guidance, especially in the challenging field of human-wildlife interactions. The goal of this review is to evaluate the realized contribution of tracking-based animal movement ecology to solving specific conservation problems, and to identify barriers that may hinder expansion of that contribution. To do this, we (a) briefly review the history and technologies used in animal tracking and bio-logging, (b) use a series of literature searches to evaluate the frequency with which movement ecology studies are designed to solve specific conservation problems, and (c) use this information to identify challenges that may limit the applied relevance of the field of movement ecology, and to propose pathways to expand that applied relevance. Our literature review quantifies the limited extent to which research in the field of movement ecology is designed to solve specific conservation problems, but also the fact that such studies are slowly becoming more prevalent. We discuss how barriers that limit application of these principles are likely due to constraints imposed by the types of data used commonly in the field. Problems of scale mismatch, error compounding, and data paucity all create challenges that are relevant to the field of movement ecology but may be especially pertinent in applied situations. Finding solutions to these problems will create new opportunity for movement ecologists to contribute to conservation science.},

   abstract = {Coastal habitats that serve as nursery grounds for numerous marine species are badly degraded, yet the traditional means of modeling populations of exploited marine species handle spatiotemporal changes in habitat characteristics and life history dynamics poorly, if at all. To explore how nursery habitat degradation impacts recruitment of a mobile, benthic species, we developed a spatially explicit, individual-based model that describes the recruitment of Caribbean spiny lobster (Panulirus argus) in the Florida Keys, where a cascade of environmental disturbances has reconfigured nursery habitat structure. In recent years, the region has experienced a series of linked perturbations, among them, seagrass die-offs, cyanobacteria blooms, and the mass mortality of sponges. Sponges are important shelters for juvenile spiny lobster, an abundant benthic predator that also sustains Florida's most valuable fishery. In the model, we simulated monthly settlement of individual lobster postlarvae and the daily growth, mortality, shelter selection, and movement of individual juvenile lobsters on a spatially explicit grid of habitat cells configured to represent the Florida Keys coastal nursery. Based on field habitat surveys, cells were designated as either seagrass or hard-bottom, and hard-bottom cells were further characterized in terms of their shelter- and size-specific lobster carrying capacities. The effect of algal blooms on sponge mortality, hence lobster habitat structure, was modeled based on the duration of exposure of each habitat cell to the blooms. Ten-year simulations of lobster recruitment with and without algal blooms suggest that the lobster population should be surprisingly resilient to massive disturbances of this type. Data not used in model development showed that predictions of large changes in lobster shelter utilization, yet small effects on recruitment in response to blooms, were realistic. The potentially severe impacts of habitat loss on recruitment were averted by compensatory changes in habitat utilization and mobility by larger individuals, coupled with periods of fortuitously high larval settlement. Our model provides an underutilized approach for assessing habitat effects on open populations with complex life histories, and our results illustrate the potential pitfalls of relying on intuition to infer the effects of habitat perturbations on upper trophic levels. © 2005 by the Ecological Society of America.},

In the course of these studies, we have used a variety of tags and tagging protocols to monitor individual animals. Here we report the use of molecular methods for the genetic analysis of nurse sharks. Specifically we have analyzed genetic variation at the MHC II α locus using the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) followed by restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) analysis of the amplified products. We found this technique to be a relatively rapid and reliable method for identifying genetic differences between individual sharks. Applying this method to a family of sharks consisting of a mother and 32 pups, we demonstrate that at least four fathers must have fathered this brood. Multiple paternity in the nurse shark suggests a mechanism by which populations of this species may maximize genetic variability. This seems especially valuable for philopatric species whose migratory movement, and thus potential for genetic diversity, is limited.},

Densities (numbers km-1 mangrove shoreline) were calculated using Jolly-Seber mark-recapture methods for mangrove-lined rivers and mangrove islands of the Ten Thousand Islands (TTI) and Everglades National Park, which includes Florida Bay, Florida, USA. Juveniles had smaller home ranges around islands (170 m) than in rivers (586 m), as determined from observations on telemetered fish. Goliath grouper remained in mangrove habitats for 5-6 yrs (validated ages from dorsal spine sections), then emigrated from mangroves at about 1.0 m total length. In the TTI, juvenile densities around mangrove islands were higher (mean = 25 km-1, SE = 6.2, CV = 0.5) and less variable than those in rivers (mean = 11 km-1, SE = 4.2, CV = 1.2). Density was negatively correlated with the frequency of dissolved oxygen and salinity minima. Mean growth rate of recaptured fish around mangrove islands (0.358 mm d-1, 95% CL = 0.317-0.398) was significantly higher than that in rivers (0.289 mm d-1, 95% CL = 0.269-0.308). The annual survival rate, as estimated by the Kaplan-Meier method on telemetered fish, was 0.947 (95% CL = 0.834-1.0). Very low densities in Florida Bay were probably related to other water-quality variables in this human-altered system. The offshore abundance of adults was largely explained by abundance of mangrove, but not seagrass habitat. Mangrove habitat with suitable water conditions, which appears essential to the recovery and sustainability of goliath-grouper populations, should be protected and/or restored. © 2007 Rosenstiel School of Marine and Atmospheric Science of the University of Miami.},

A 24-mo trawl survey determined that Haemulon plumierii (Lacépède, 1801), Lagodon rhomboides (Linnaeus, 1766), Monacanthus ciliatus (Mitchill, 1818), and Eucinostomus spp. constituted nearly 70% of small-bodied fishes in FKNMS seagrasses. Mean abundance and species richness were significantly higher in areas containing larger, denser, and more structurally complex seagrass beds on the Gulf of Mexico side, especially in the middle and lower Keys, than in the sparser and less complex Atlantic seagrass beds, which are much closer to the Florida reef tract. There was limited seasonal variation in fish-assemblage composition. Abiotic factors (water temperature, salinity, and dissolved oxygen) appeared less important in defining assemblages than biotic characteristics (i.e., seagrass structure). The only prevalent, economically important reef-associated fishes using the seagrass beds as nurseries were H. plumierii, Lutjanus synagris (Linnaeus, 1758), and Lachnolaimus maximus (Walbaum, 1792). Many coral-reef-associated families were absent and most members of the locally important snapper-grouper complex (Lutjanidae and Serranidae) were captured infrequently. This may be attributable to distance from the reefs and also because some of these species inhabit seagrasses nocturnally and so were not collected by the diurnal trawling. © 2007 Rosenstiel School of Marine and Atmospheric Science of the University of Miami.},

   abstract = {Information on the movements and population structure of an exploited fish species is vital for determining the appropriate spatial scale at which management should occur to ensure sustainable harvesting. However, such information exists for very few exploited species. Large-scale patterns and drivers of movement were examined for an iconic recreational sciaenid species, mulloway (Argyrosomus japonicus), in coastal eastern Australia using an angler-assisted tag-recapture dataset. Over 4300 individuals were tagged and released across 1005 km of coastline over three decades (1988–2017). Six-hundred and fifty-seven individuals were subsequently recaptured at a rate of 15.1% over the same time period. Average time at liberty was 216 (±9) days (range: 0–1954 days), with distances moved ranging from 0 to 355 km. Median movement distance was 4 km, and a large proportion of individuals (73%) were recaptured within 10 km of release locations. Thirty one percent of individuals were recaptured at release locations (< 1 km) and 81% in the same estuary. However, 7% moved distances of > 100 km. Generalised additive modelling revealed that release latitude, body size and time at liberty were significant predictors of distance moved. Greater distances moved were observed for fish tagged at lower latitudes, at larger sizes and over longer periods at liberty. Results indicate that A. japonicus are primarily restricted to small movements (< 10 km) in eastern Australia and display strong site fidelity, despite being capable of movements over larger scales (100s of km). This spatial scale of movement is also much smaller than the current ‘jurisdictional’ scale of management in this region (~1000 km). Assessment and management of A. japonicus in eastern Australia may therefore need to be re-examined considering these findings and potentially undertaken at more localised spatial scales in the future. This study also highlights the importance of citizen science in the cost-effective generation of a sufficiently broad spatio-temporal dataset required to detect the movement patterns revealed here.},

Largescale marine CS projects, such as the Oceanographic Research Institute’s Cooperative Fish Tagging Project, have made enormous contributions to marine scientific research. Individual citizen scientists have also made considerable contributions, particularly in taxonomy and the publication of field guides. Marine CS has also contributed towards the popularisation of science and improved scientific literacy through the active engagement of many citizens. These benefits align well with the visions of policies that currently guide the South African marine research agenda. However, marine CS in the developing world is not without challenges, and practitioners should be cognisant of the time and effort required to initiate and maintain viable CS initiatives. Especially, long-term successful CS projects depend on secure, ongoing funding, institutional support and enthusiastic champions. Participation by almost exclusively the urban and middle-class sectors of society is also of concern. These challenges can be addressed through stakeholder-inclusive planning, development of novel methods that engage with broader sectors of society, and regular critical evaluations of CS projects. Where global projects on the intended taxa/subject of study already exist, it may also be preferable to enter into collaborative data-sharing agreements with these to reduce operational costs and avoid duplication.},

   abstract = {Many organisms have complex life cycles with distinct life stages that experience different environmental conditions. How does the complexity of life cycles affect the ecological and evolutionary responses of organisms to climate change? We address this question by exploring several recent case studies and synthetic analyses of insects. First, different life stages may inhabit different microhabitats, and may differ in their thermal sensitivities and other traits that are important for responses to climate. For example, the life stages of Manduca experience different patterns of thermal and hydric variability, and differ in tolerance to high temperatures. Second, life stages may differ in their mechanisms for adaptation to local climatic conditions. For example, in Colias, larvae in different geographic populations and species adapt to local climate via differences in optimal and maximal temperatures for feeding and growth, whereas adults adapt via differences in melanin of the wings and in other morphological traits. Third, we extend a recent analysis of the temperature-dependence of insect population growth to demonstrate how changes in temperature can differently impact juvenile survival and adult reproduction. In both temperate and tropical regions, high rates of adult reproduction in a given environment may not be realized if occasional, high temperatures prevent survival to maturity. This suggests that considering the differing responses of multiple life stages is essential to understand the ecological and evolutionary consequences of climate change.},

At Ishigaki Island, southern Japan, black-tail snapper Lutjanus fulvus juveniles often occur in mangroves, whereas subadults and adults are usually found on coral reefs. To test the hypothesis that L. fulvus uses mangroves as a nursery, we conducted stomach content and stable isotope analyses of L. fulvus collected from mangroves and an adjacent coral reef. Stomach content analysis showed that specimens from mangroves fed on mangrove-associated prey, whereas those from the coral reef took coral reef-associated prey, indicating that the species undergoes ontogenetic changes in resource use from the mangroves to the coral reef, i.e. coral reef individuals did not migrate to the mangroves to feed. Stable isotope analysis showed that potential prey and mangrove red snapper L. argentimaculatus (control fish for mangroves) collected from the mangroves had 13C-depleted values of -23 to -17‰, distinct from the -16 to -8‰ values of potential prey and humpback red snapper L. gibbus (control fish for coral reef) collected from the coral reef. δ13C values of L. fulvus in the mangroves had a mangrove signature, whereas individuals on the coral reef gradually shifted from a mangrove signature to a coral reef signature with growth, indicating that small individuals on the coral reef were recent migrants from the mangroves. Based on the δ13C values of the subadult population of L. fulvus on the coral reef, 36 of 41 individuals were estimated to have inhabited the mangroves during their juvenile stage, demonstrating that L. fulvus used the mangroves as a nursery. © Inter-Research 2008.},

   abstract = {Background: Over the past 15 years, the integration of localised passive telemetry networks into centralised data repositories has greatly enhanced our ability to monitor the presence and movements of highly mobile and migratory species. These large-scale networks are now generating big data, allowing meta-analyses across multiple species, locations, and temporal scales. Broad-scale comparisons of animal movement metrics are constrained by the use of diverse analytical techniques among researchers. Accordingly, there is a need for a tool-set to assist in calculating animal movement metrics that can be easily applied to datasets from local studies to large-scale cooperative networks. Results: We present a standardised framework and an associated analysis tool-set that facilitates the calculation of a range of activity space and movement metrics for passive telemetry datasets. Application of the tool-set is demonstrated using data from the Integrated Marine Observing System continental-scale network of underwater acoustic receivers. We show how the metrics can: (1) be directly compared among multiple species monitored at multiple sites; (2) be compared among multiple species tagged at a single study site; and (3) assess changes in activity space metrics over time. Conclusions: Establishing a framework and tool-set to analyse data from large-scale networks progresses the field of passive telemetry beyond the traditional individual-, species-, or location-centric approaches to facilitate national- or international-scale outputs that better address important questions in the field of movement ecology.},

   abstract = {Partial migration, where only some individuals from a population migrate, has been widely reported in a diverse range of animals. In this paper, what is known about the causes and consequences of partial migration in fishes is reviewed. Firstly, the ultimate and proximate drivers of partial migration are reflected upon: what ecological factors can shape the evolution of migratory dimorphism? How is partial migration maintained over evolutionary timescales? What proximate mechanisms determine whether an individual is migratory or remains resident? Following this, the consequences of partial migration are considered, in an ecological and evolutionary context, and also in an applied sense. Here it is argued that understanding the concept of partial migration is crucial for fisheries and ecosystem managers, and can provide information for conservation strategies. The review concludes with a reflection on the future opportunities in this field, and the avenues of research that are likely to be fruitful to shed light on the enduring puzzle of partial migration in fishes. © 2012 The Authors.

We analyzed a 34-year time series of eastern Bering Sea fish surveys to evaluate changes in distribution by length and between cold and warm shelf-wide average water temperatures for 20 species over inhabited depth, temperature, and location. All species showed evidence of ontogenetic migration. Differences in distribution between years with warm and years with cold shelf-wide water temperatures varied among species and within species at different lengths. For species where shelf-wide temperature effects were detected, the mid-sized fish were most active in changing spatial distribution. For aquatic organisms ontogenetic migration occurs because life history stages have different environmental requirements. This study illustrates the need to consider species responses to climate change over different life history stages, and that studies on ecosystem responses should take ontogenetic differences into consideration when assessing impacts.},

This technology offers researchers the opportunity to monitor the finite- to broad-scale movements of multiple individuals over many years; however, the sheer scale and spatial complexity of these datasets are often beyond the capabilities of routine database and spread-sheet applications. In the present paper, we describe software (V-Track) that greatly facilitates the assimilation, analysis and synthesis of animal-location data collected by underwater passive acoustic receivers. The principal features within V-Track are the behavioural event qualifier (BEQ) and the receiver-distance matrix (RDM) calculator. The BEQ identifies and catalogues horizontal movements from receiver detection data, or vertical movements from transmitter sensor data (depth or temperature). The RDM is generated from the geographical location of the acoustic receivers and is utilised by V-Track to illustrate the behavioural event information in a spatial context. V-Track is a package written within the R-programming language, and a graphical user interface is also provided. Here, we feature two case studies to demonstrate software functionality for defining and quantifying behaviour in acoustically tagged marine and freshwater vertebrates. © CSIRO 2012.},

   abstract = {Acoustic telemetry studies have frequently prioritized linear configurations of hydrophone receivers, such as perpendicular from shorelines or across rivers, to detect the presence of tagged aquatic animals. This approach introduces unknown bias when receivers are stationed for convenience at geographic bottlenecks (e.g. at the mouth of an embayment or between islands) as opposed to deployments following a statistical sampling design. We evaluated two-dimensional acoustic receiver arrays (grids: receivers spread uniformly across space) as an alternative approach to provide estimates of survival, movement and habitat use. Performance of variably spaced receiver grids (5–25 km spacing) was evaluated by simulating (1) animal tracks as correlated random walks (speed: 0.1–0.9 m/s; turning angle SD: 5–30°); (2) variable tag transmission intervals along each track (nominal delay: 15–300 s); and (3) probability of detection of each transmission based on logistic detection range curves (mid-point: 200–1,500 m). From simulations, we quantified (i) time between successive detections on any receiver (detection time), (ii) time between successive detections on different receivers (transit time), and (iii) distance between successive detections on different receivers (transit distance). In the most restrictive detection range scenario (200 m), the 95th percentile of transit time was 3.2 days at 5 km, 5.7 days at 7 km and 15.2 days at 25 km grid spacing; for the 1,500 m detection range scenario, it was 0.1 days at 5 km, 0.5 days at 7 km and 10.8 days at 25 km. These values represented upper bounds on the expected maximum time that an animal could go undetected. Comparison of the simulations with pilot studies on three fishes (walleye Sander vitreus, common carp Cyprinus carpio and channel catfish Ictalurus punctatus) from two independent large lake ecosystems (lakes Erie and Winnipeg) revealed shorter detection and transit times than what simulations predicted. By spreading effort uniformly across space, grids can improve understanding of fish migration over the commonly employed receiver line approach, but at increased time cost for maintaining grids.},

On the west coast of Florida, the interaction between ontogenetically migrating reef fish and fishing effort is an important contributor to the pattern of fishing mortality. A biased random walk model was developed to represent the movement of red grouper Epinephelus morio from the inshore nursery habitat occupied by juveniles to the offshore reef habitat inhabited by adults on the West Florida Shelf. A simulated tagging study was conducted to develop distributions of movement speed. Time at large, release location, and input movement speed from conventional tagging data were used to parameterize the simulation. Maturity at age, determined when fish began moving, and directional movement behavior were modeled as functions of preferential habitat. The results suggest that the general movement of tagged fish can be represented using simple assumptions. Comparison of the tagging study and the tagging simulation showed no statistical differences between these two in terms of movement speed, distance traveled, mean size of fish at release, and mean size of fish at recapture. Furthermore, the age distribution of the fish arriving at the reef in the model matched the observed age distribution in the commercial catch. © 2012 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.},

We also provide a framework for interactions induced by migratory coupling and demonstrate their potential community-level impacts by examining other forms of spatial shifts in predators.

   abstract = {Red grouper (Epinephelus morio) is an economically important species in the reef fish community of the south-eastern United States, and especially the Gulf of Mexico. It is relatively common in karst regions of the Gulf and is asso-ciated with low-relief rocky features devoid of overlying sediments. Working both inshore in Florida Bay, Florida (U.S.A.), and offshore in the Gulf of Mexico shelf-edge fishery reserves, Madison Swanson and Steamboat Lumps, we characterized red-grouper habitat and the associated faunal assemblages and demonstrated through a series of experiments that red grouper expose rocky habitat by excavating with their mouths and fanning with their fins to clear away surficial sediment, thereby providing habitat for themselves as well as other reef-dwelling organisms. They also maintain this habi-tat by periodically clearing away sediment and debris. Such maintenance provides a clean rocky substrate for the attach-ment of sessile invertebrates, thereby modifying habitat features to provide refuge for many other species of fish and mo-tile invertebrates. We demonstrated increased biodiversity and abundance associated with habitat structured by red grou-per, and we speculate here as to its fishery importance as habitat for other economically important species such as spiny lobster (Panulirus argus) and vermilion snapper (Rhomboplites aurorubens).},

   abstract = {Mapping the spatial distributions of fish populations is an integral component of ecosystem-based fisheries management (EBFM). Particularly for red grouper (Epinephelus morio) and gag grouper (“gag”; Mycteroperca microlepis), two economically important species, the lack of mapping due to data limitations (i.e., inconsistent capture in research surveys) has left a critical gap in the science needed to assess how ecosystem processes and EBFM measures in the Gulf of Mexico (GOM) impact their population dynamics. We combined multiple fisheries-dependent and fisheries-independent data sources to map the long-term spatial distributions of older juveniles and adults of red and gag groupers in the U.S. GOM, using spatio-temporal binomial generalized linear mixed models (GLMMs). Spatio-temporal binomial GLMMs rely on the idea that probability of encounter at a given site is more similar to probability of encounter at nearby sites than to probability of encounter at geographically remote locations; this tenet allows one to estimate a smoothed surface depicting how probability of encounter varies spatially. Our spatio-temporal binomial GLMMs do not integrate environmental covariates, yet they account for the effects of year and research survey. The distribution maps produced from the predictions of the spatio-temporal binomial GLMMs aligned with the current understanding of the long-term ontogenetic spatial distributions of red and gag groupers in the U.S. GOM. Red grouper was predicted to be encountered throughout the West Florida Shelf (WFS), primarily at depths ranging from 20 to 60 m. Both older juvenile and adult female gags were predicted to be encountered from Apalachicola, Florida, to the region northwest of Tampa, Florida, along the 20 m depth contour, especially in Apalachee Bay. The probability of encounter of adult female gag was also high in the Florida Middle Grounds and in deeper (>40 m) areas of the WFS. The probability of encounter of adult male gag was highest along the edge of the WFS, both inside recognized spawning grounds (including the Madison-Swanson marine protected area) and outside, i.e., below 27°N (including Pulley Ridge). The distribution maps produced are valuable for understanding the ecology of grouper species and can be used as a basis for further analyses. Our spatio-temporal binomial GLMM framework will serve many important EBFM projects, including the construction of reliable distribution maps in bulk for spatially explicit ecosystem models of the GOM, which will improve spatial distributions and species spatial overlaps in spatially explicit ecosystem models and, therefore, the trophic interactions predicted by these models.},

Drones are relatively easy to operate over meters-to-kilometer scales, making them potentially useful to monitor species distributions and habitat use in shallow-water estuaries, which have widely varying environmental conditions. Determining effects of estuarine environmental conditions on detection rates by drones is important for understanding the efficacy of this approach for documenting patterns of distribution and abundance. To investigate the utility of drones for surveying bonnethead sharks (Sphyrna tiburo) in a temperate estuary, we field deployed decoys fashioned to mimic the appearance of both bonnethead and non- bonnethead sharks. Decoys were placed in two flight areas (0.8 km2 each) in shallow (< 2 m) waters near Beaufort, NC, on five days during 2015-2016. Survey flights were conducted using a fixed-wing drone Abstract: (senseFly eBee®) equipped with digital cameras to capture images from overhead. Images were indexed for combinations of 6 environmental factors present across survey flights: 2 categorical (cloud presence, spectral filter) and 4 continuous (time of day, wind speed, secchi depth, decoy depth). Images representative of all observed combinations (36 unique combinations; 43 unique images) were sent to a group of scientists (n = 15 scorers), who were asked to identify the presence/location of sharks in each image. Correctly spotted decoys, decoys not detected, and false detections were tabulated and used to calculate detection probabilities. The influences of environmental factors on detection were estimated using non-parametric rank sum tests and regression trees. Detection probabilities for decoys across environmental conditions ranged from 0 to 1 with an overall mean value of 0.27 + 0.38 (mean + 1 SD). Univariate factor-level comparisons highlighted depth and time of day as having the largest, statistically-reliable influences ondetection, although there were also notable trends with wind speed and cloud cover. Type of camera had no effect on detection probability. Our regression tree analysis reinforced the effects of depth and wind speed. Our study highlights depth as a first-order factor constraining the range of temperate estuarine habitats over which drones can reliably quantify distribution and abundance of sharks. For},

   abstract = {Temperature is one of the most influential drivers of physiological performance and behaviour in ectotherms, determining how these animals relate to their ecosystems and their ability to succeed in particular habitats. Here, we analysed the largest set of acceleration data compiled to date for elasmobranchs to examine the relationship between volitional activity and temperature in 252 individuals from 8 species. We calculated activation energies for the thermal performance response in each species and estimated optimum temperatures using an Arrhenius breakpoint analysis, subsequently fitting thermal performance curves to the activity data. Juveniles living in confined nursery habitats not only spent substantially more time above their optimum temperature and at the upper limits of their performance breadths compared to larger, less site-restricted animals, but also showed lower activation energies and broader performance curves. Species or life stages occupying confined habitats featured more generalist behavioural responses to temperature change, whereas wider ranging elasmobranchs were characterised by more specialist behavioural responses. The relationships between the estimated performance regimes and environmental temperature limits suggest that animals in confined habitats, including many juvenile elasmobranchs within nursery habitats, are likely to experience a reduction of performance under a warming climate, although their flatter thermal response will likely dampen this impact. The effect of warming on less site-restricted species is difficult to forecast since three of four species studied here did not reach their optimum temperature in the wild, although their specialist performance characteristics may indicate a more rapid decline should optimum temperatures be exceeded.},

The mean minimum linear dispersal (MID) was 10.5 km for Caribbean reef sharks and 7.7 km for nurse sharks, with many individuals traveling more than the 10 km width of the no-take "conservation zone" of the marine reserve. Although most sharks were tagged within the conservation zone, individuals were detected outside this part of GRMR on average 48 days out of the 150 days of observations. However, of 7 nurse sharks tagged near the center of the conservation zone, 4 were never detected outside of this part of the reserve. In general, this study suggests that effective conservation of these large roving predators requires an ecosystem-based management approach including a zoned management plan, similar to that used at GRMR, in which a fairly large no-take reserve, incorporating diverse habitats and the connections between them, is surrounded by a larger area in which fishing is regulated.},

   abstract = {Many species of sharks form aggregations around oceanic islands, yet their levels of residency and their site specificity around these islands may vary. In some cases, the waters around oceanic islands have been designated as marine protected areas, yet the conservation value for threatened shark species will depend greatly on how much time they spend within these protected waters. Eighty-four scalloped hammerhead sharks (Sphyrna lewini Griffith & Smith), were tagged with acoustic transmitters at Cocos Island between 2005–2013. The average residence index, expressed as a proportion of days present in our receiver array at the island over the entire monitoring period, was 0.52±0.31, implying that overall the sharks are strongly associated with the island. Residency was significantly greater at Alcyone, a shallow seamount located 3.6 km offshore from the main island, than at the other sites. Timing of presence at the receiver locations was mostly during daytime hours. Although only a single individual from Cocos was detected on a region-wide array, nine hammerheads tagged at Galapagos and Malpelo travelled to Cocos. The hammerheads tagged at Cocos were more resident than those visiting from elsewhere, suggesting that the Galapagos and Malpelo populations may use Cocos as a navigational waypoint or stopover during seasonal migrations to the coastal Central and South America. Our study demonstrates the importance of oceanic islands for this species, and shows that they may form a network of hotspots in the Eastern Tropical Pacific.},

   abstract = {Understanding the efficacy of marine protected areas (MPAs) for wide-ranging predators is essential to designing effective management and conservation approaches. The use of acoustic monitoring and network analysis can improve our understanding of the spatial ecology and functional connectivity of reef-associated species, providing a useful approach for reef-based conservation planning. This study compared and contrasted the movement and connectivity of sharks with different degrees of reef association. We examined the residency, dispersal, degree of reef connectivity, and MPA use of grey reef (Carcharhinus amblyrhynchos), silvertip (C. albimarginatus), and bull (C. leucas) sharks monitored in the central Great Barrier Reef (GBR). An array of 56 acoustic receivers was used to monitor shark movements on 17 semi-isolated reefs. Carcharhinus amblyrhynchos and C. albimarginatus were detected most days at or near their tagging reef. However, while C. amblyrhynchos spent 80% of monitoring days in the array, C. albimarginatus was only detected 50% of the time. Despite both species moving similar distances (,50 km), a large portion of the population of C. albimarginatus (71%) was detected on multiple reefs and moved more frequently between reefs and management zones than C. amblyrhynchos. Carcharhinus leucas was detected less than 20% of the time within the tagging array, and 42% of the population undertook long-range migrations to other arrays in the GBR. Networks derived for C. leucas were larger and more complex than those for C. amblyrhynchos and C. albimarginatus. Our findings suggest that protecting specific reefs based on prior knowledge (e.g., healthier reefs with high fish biomass) and increasing the level of protection to include nearby, closely spaced reef habitats (,20 km) may perform better for species like C. albimarginatus than having either a single or a network of isolated MPAs. This design would also provide protection for larger male C. amblyrhynchos, which tend to disperse more and use larger areas than females. For wide-ranging sharks like C. leucas, a combination of spatial planning and other alternative measures is critical. Our findings demonstrate that acoustic monitoring can serve as a useful platform for designing more effective MPA networks for reef predators displaying a range of movement patterns.},

Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) offer a useful mechanism to protect these species and their roles in coral reef ecosystems. The effectiveness of MPAs notably relies on compliance together with sufficient size to encompass animal home range. Here, we measured home range of 147 grey reef sharks, Carcharhinus amblyrhynchos, using acoustic telemetry in New Caledonia. The distribution of home range was then compared to local MPA sizes. We report a home range of 12 km2 of reef for the species with strong differences between adult males (21 km2), adult females (4.4 km2) and juveniles (6.2 km2 for males, 2.7 km2 for females). Whereas local historic MPA size seemed adequate to protect reef shark home range in general, these were clearly too small when considering adult males only, which is consistent with the reported failure of MPAs to protect sharks in New Caledonia. Fortunately, the recent implementation of several orders of magnitude larger MPAs in New Caledonia and abroad show that recent Indo-Pacific MPAs are now sufficiently large to protect the home ranges of this species, including males, across its geographical range. However, protection efforts are concentrated in a few regions and cannot provide adequate protection at a global scale.},

Historically, this role has been fulfilled with low-tech conventional tags, but the relatively recent and rapid development of electronic tags has dramatically increased the potential to collect more high quality data. Stock assessment models have also been evolving in power and complexity recently, with the ability to integrate multiple data sources into unified spatially explicit frameworks. However, electronic tag technologies and stock assessment models have developed largely independently, and frameworks for incorporating these valuable data in contemporary stock assessments are nascent, at best. Movement dynamics of large pelagic species have been problematic to resolve in modern assessments, and electronic tags offer new opportunities to resolve some of these issues. Pragmatic ways of modeling movement are often not obvious, and basic research into discrete and continuous processes, for example, is ongoing. Experimental design of electronic tagging research has been driven mostly by ecological and biological questions, rather than optimized for stock assessment, and this is probably a complicating factor in integration of the data into assessment models. A holistic overview of the current state of assessment models, electronic tag technologies, and experimental design is provided here, with the aim to provide insight into how stock assessment and electronic tagging research can be conducted most effectively together.},

   abstract = {The conservation and protection of fish habitat in support of Canada's coastal and inland fisheries is the mandate of Canada's Fish Habitat Management Programme. The programme's objective of a net gain of the productive capacity of habitat is achieved by a variety of actions that protect fish habitat but allow works and undertakings in and around water. Some of the core activities include a review of works and proposals for adherence to the requirements of the Fisheries Act, the issuance of letters of mitigation advice, and authorisation and enforcement activities for compliance with legislation and policies. The programme is enhanced through working with partners in community outreach activities, the generation of mitigation guidelines and fact sheets, as well as compliance monitoring and assessment. This paper presents an overview of the Canadian Fish Habitat Management Programme and focuses on how an expanded programme is being managed within the Province of Ontario. Habitat managers' tools used to protect the resource are detailed. In 1997, an expanded programme for habitat management was initiated. Subsequently, there has been greater emphasis on advice to clients, agency partnerships and public education. Focussing on redesign and relocation of projects and mitigation of harmful effects has likely resulted in the reduction of the number of authorisations for habitat destruction in this period, despite an overall increase in project referrals for review. Once the Habitat Management Programme is fully implemented across Canada, it will be possible, through monitoring and review, to assess whether there is a greater achievement of no net loss of the productive capacity of habitat and potentially a net gain. This programme of habitat protection and conservation could serve as a model for other jurisdictions. © 2004 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.},

Many areas are claimed to be protected, with little understanding by either the general public or even most marine resource experts as to what human activities are actually regulated by legislative designations. Second, we present an overview of biological reasons and objectives for marine protected areas, followed by a review of both the conservation and fisheries management effects and implications resulting from effective renewable resource protection. Finally, we propose a unique qualitative scheme for classifying and describing marine protected areas of different types to determine relative measures of protection.},

MPAs are efficient for conservation purposes and resource restoration, especially inside their borders. MPAs can also be part of fisheries management systems, but there is a lack of knowledge about their wider scale impacts on fish stocks, ecosystem and fisheries. Adjacent fisheries can increase their catches near closed areas, but such effects are delayed until after MPA establishment and are often limited over distance. Even though local specificities in ecosystems and fishing resources lead to high variability in MPA effects, four major criteria modulate the efficiency of MPAs for fisheries management: (1) the size of the closed area; (2) the level of protection of essential habitats for exploited resources; (3) MPA integration as part of wider integrated fisheries management plans; and (4) efficient monitoring and regulation systems, including participative decision making, to ensure that restrictive measures are respected. © EDP Sciences, IFREMER, IRD 2013.},

This thematic Assessment of Land Degradation and Restoration has been carried out by 98 selected authors and 7 early career fellows, assisted by 79 contributing authors, who have analyzed a large body of knowledge, including about 4,000 scientific and other sources. It represents the state of knowledge of land degradation and restoration. Its chapters and their executive summaries were accepted, and its summary for policymakers was approved, by the Plenary of IPBES at its sixth session (18-24 March 2018, Medellín, Colombia). This Report provides a critical assessment of the full range of issues facing decision makers, including the importance, status, trends and threats to biodiversity and nature’s contributions to people, as well as policy and management response options. Establishing the underlying causes of land degradation provides policymakers with the information needed to develop appropriate response options, technologies, policies, financial incentives and behavior changes. The Report recognizes that combatting land degradation, which is a pervasive, systemic phenomenon occurring in all parts of the world, is an urgent priority in order to protect the biodiversity and ecosystem services that are vital to all life on Earth and to ensure human well-being. Land degradation negatively impacts 3.2 billion people, and represents an economic loss in the order of 10% of annual global gross product. The Report concludes that avoiding land degradation and restoring degraded lands makes sound economic sense, resulting in, inter-alia, increased food and water security, increased employment, improved gender equality, and avoidance of conflict and migration. Avoiding land degradation and restoring degraded lands are also essential for meeting the Sustainable Development Goals.},

Although populations may be limited by available habitat for a single life history stage, altering habitat quality for subsequent stages will also affect individual survival and population size, providing multiple leverage points within a life history for habitat management to achieve recovery targets.

   abstract = {Freshwater fish move vertically and horizontally through the aquatic landscape for a variety of reasons, such as to find and exploit patchy resources or to locate essential habitats (e.g., for spawning). Inherent challenges exist with the assessment of fish populations because they are moving targets. We submit that quantifying and describing the spatial ecology of fish and their habitat is an important component of freshwater fishery assessment and management. With a growing number of tools available for studying the spatial ecology of fishes (e.g., telemetry, population genetics, hydroacoustics, otolith microchemistry, stable isotope analysis), new knowledge can now be generated and incorporated into biological assessment and fishery management. For example, knowing when, where, and how to deploy assessment gears is essential to inform, refine, or calibrate assessment protocols. Such information is also useful for quantifying or avoiding bycatch of imperiled species. Knowledge of habitat connectivity and usage can identify critically important migration corridors and habitats and can be used to improve our understanding of variables that influence spatial structuring of fish populations. Similarly, demographic processes are partly driven by the behavior of fish and mediated by environmental drivers. Information on these processes is critical to the development and application of realistic population dynamics models. Collectively, biological assessment, when informed by knowledge of spatial ecology, can provide managers with the ability to understand how and when fish and their habitats may be exposed to different threats. Naturally, this knowledge helps to better evaluate or develop strategies to protect the long-term viability of fishery production. Failure to understand the spatial ecology of fishes and to incorporate spatiotemporal data can bias population assessments and forecasts and potentially lead to ineffective or counterproductive management actions.},

   abstract = {Coastal ecosystems provide many vital ecological and economic services, including shoreline protection, productive commercial and sport fisheries, and nutrient cycling. Key nearshore ecosystems such as seagrass meadows, marshes, and mangrove forests are particularly valued for their extremely high productivity, which supports a great abundance and diversity of fish as well as shrimp, oysters, crabs, and other invertebrates. Because of the abundance of juvenile fish and shellfish they contain, nearshore ecosystems are widely considered nurseries. The nursery role of coastal estuaries and marine ecosystems is well accepted by scientists, conservation organizations, fisheries managers, and the public, and it is often cited to support protection and conservation of these areas. Nonetheless, comparatively little money and effort is being directed at protecting and managing these ecosystems. Until recently, even fisheries managers have largely ignored the issue of identification and conservation of juvenile habitat. This neglect, combined with intense pressures from human activities, is causing continued decline in vital nearshore habitats. We believe a better understanding of habitats that serve as nurseries for marine species is needed to help prioritize the limited funding and effort available for their protection and management. Based on the scientific evidence, we conclude that: The concept of nursery habitat has been poorly defined. Lack of a clear definition has hindered identification of valuable nursery habitats. There is variation between and within ecosystems in their value as nurseries, and the nursery value of seagrass meadows, wetlands, and other ecosystems varies geographically. Many ecosystems such as oyster reefs and kelp forests have been relatively unexamined as nurseries. A better understanding of the factors that create site-specific variability in nursery quality will help prioritize efforts to halt their decline. We suggest as a testable hypothesis that a nearshore habitat serves as a nursery for juveniles of a particular fish or invertebrate species if it contributes disproportionately to the size and numbers of adults relative to other juvenile habitats. The disproportionate contribution to the production of adults can come from any combination of four factors: density, growth, and survival of juvenile animals, and their movement to adult habitats. We further suggest that in future research on putative nurseries: It is not sufficient to measure a single factor such as density of juveniles. Researchers must compare multiple habitats, and an area should be considered important nursery habitat only if it produces relatively more adults per unit of area than other juvenile habitats the species uses. Despite the difficulties, researchers must track the number of individuals that move from juvenile to adult habitats; this number is the best measure of nursery value. Researchers should examine the factors that contribute to local variations in the value of nursery habitat. For example, not all marshes function equally as nurseries. An understanding of local variations could also help to explain regional changes in the nursery value of some habitats. Conservation and management organizations now commonly consider all seagrass meadows and wetlands as nurseries, an assumption that may hinder the protection of other ecosystems vital to the protection of marine biodiversity as well as commercial fishery stocks. In the past, management effort has often focused on the restoration of these ecosystems. Future research needs to be devoted to measuring whether restoration reinstates the functional value of ecosystems as nurseries. Currently, results of restoration efforts are equivocal at best. Where restoration and mitigation cannot be shown to return nursery value, more effort should be focused on conservation. Better research and a clearer understanding of nursery habitats will allow more efficient use of limited money, time, and effort in conservation and management and contribute to the development of true ecosystem-based management of coastal resources.},

Yet, a lingering paradigm among natural scientists, conservationists, and policymakers is that human transformation of terrestrial nature is mostly recent and inherently destructive. Here, we use the most up-to-date, spatially explicit global reconstruction of historical human populations and land use to show that this paradigm is likely wrong. Even 12,000 y ago, nearly three quarters of Earth’s land was inhabited and therefore shaped by human societies, including more than 95% of temperate and 90% of tropical woodlands. Lands now characterized as “natural,” “intact,” and “wild” generally exhibit long histories of use, as do protected areas and Indigenous lands, and current global patterns of vertebrate species richness and key biodiversity areas are more strongly associated with past patterns of land use than with present ones in regional landscapes now characterized as natural. The current biodiversity crisis can seldom be explained by the loss of uninhabited wildlands, resulting instead from the appropriation, colonization, and intensifying use of the biodiverse cultural landscapes long shaped and sustained by prior societies. Recognizing this deep cultural connection with biodiversity will therefore be essential to resolve the crisis.},

The SREX approaches the topic by assessing the scientific literature on issues that range from the relationship between climate change and extreme weather and climate events (‘climate extremes’) to the implications of these events for society and sustainable development. The assessment concerns the interaction of climatic, environmental, and human factors that can lead to impacts and disasters, options for managing the risks posed by impacts and disasters, and the important role that non-climatic factors play in determining impacts. Box SPM.1 defines concepts central to the SREX. The character and severity of impacts from climate extremes depend not only on the extremes themselves but also on exposure and vulnerability. In this report, adverse impacts are considered disasters when they produce widespread damage and cause severe alterations in the normal functioning of communities or societies. Climate extremes, exposure, and vulnerability are influenced by a wide range of factors, including anthropogenic climate change, natural climate variability, and socioeconomic development (Figure SPM.1). Disaster risk management and adaptation to climate change focus on reducing exposure and vulnerability and increasing resilience to the potential adverse impacts of climate extremes, even though risks cannot fully be eliminated (Figure SPM.2).

   abstract = {The search for novel approaches to establishing ecological baselines (reference conditions) is constrained by the fact that most ecological studies span the past few decades, at most, and investigate ecosystems that have been substantially altered by human activities for decades, centuries, or more. Paleobiology, archeology, and history provide historical ecological context for biological conservation, remediation, and restoration. We argue that linking historical ecology explicitly with conservation can help unify related disciplines of conservation paleobiology, conservation archeobiology, and environmental history. Differences in the spatial and temporal resolution and extent (scale) of prehistoric, historic, and modern ecological data remain obstacles to integrating historical ecology and conservation biology, but the prolonged temporal extents of historical ecological data can help establish more complete baselines for restoration, document a historical range of ecological variability, and assist in determining desired future conditions. We used the eastern oyster (Crassostrea virginica) fishery of the Chesapeake Bay (U.S.A.) to demonstrate the utility of historical ecological data for elucidating oyster conservation and the need for an approach to conservation that transcends disciplinary boundaries. Historical ecological studies from the Chesapeake have documented dramatic declines (as much as 99%) in oyster abundance since the early to mid-1800s, changes in oyster size in response to different nutrient levels from the sixteenth to nineteenth centuries, and substantial reductions in oyster accretion rates (from 10 mm/year to effectively 0 mm/year) from the Late Holocene to modern times. Better integration of different historical ecological data sets and increased collaboration between paleobiologists, geologists, archeologists, environmental historians, and ecologists to create standardized research designs and methodologies will help unify prehistoric, historic, and modern time perspectives on biological conservation. © 2012 Society for Conservation Biology.},

   abstract = {Abstract: We developed a multiple-gear survey (183-m haul seine and 6.1-m otter trawl) that was designed to supplement long-term, fishery-independent survey data on age-0 Gags Mycteroperca microlepis in Apalachicola Bay, Tampa Bay, and Charlotte Harbor, Florida. The supplemental survey design specifically considered juvenile Gag recruitment ecology and thus targeted the deep, polyhaline seagrass habitats that are utilized by age-0 Gags yet infrequently sampled. It also expanded the spatial coverage of ongoing surveys to include two unsampled estuaries (St. Andrew Bay and Big Bend [Apalachee Bay]) where Gag recruitment had been documented. Analyses of data collected in long-term and supplemental surveys (2008–2012) demonstrated the effectiveness of this sampling approach. The size ranges of Gags collected in long-term and supplemental surveys were similar, but age-0 individuals were captured more frequently and CPUE was significantly higher in the supplemental surveys. Interannual patterns of variability in Gag recruitment were similar between gear types and among sampling designs, although the coefficient of variation was lowest for the combined data from long-term and supplemental seine surveys. Data from these complementary surveys will improve our ability to characterize age-0 Gag recruitment. Nevertheless, additional information on habitat availability—combined with a better understanding of the estuarine systems' relative contributions to nearshore Gag populations—will be required to maximize the utility of these data in predicting fisheries productivity.

   abstract = {Background: Because empirical studies of animal movement are most-often site- and species-specific, we lack understanding of the level of consistency in movement patterns across diverse taxa, as well as a framework for quantitatively classifying movement patterns. We aim to address this gap by determining the extent to which statistical signatures of animal movement patterns recur across ecological systems. We assessed a suite of movement metrics derived from GPS trajectories of thirteen marine and terrestrial vertebrate species spanning three taxonomic classes, orders of magnitude in body size, and modes of movement (swimming, flying, walking). Using these metrics, we performed a principal components analysis and cluster analysis to determine if individuals organized into statistically distinct clusters. Finally, to identify and interpret commonalities within clusters, we compared them to computer-simulated idealized movement syndromes representing suites of correlated movement traits observed across taxa (migration, nomadism, territoriality, and central place foraging). Results: Two principal components explained 70% of the variance among the movement metrics we evaluated across the thirteen species, and were used for the cluster analysis. The resulting analysis revealed four statistically distinct clusters. All simulated individuals of each idealized movement syndrome organized into separate clusters, suggesting that the four clusters are explained by common movement syndrome. Conclusions: Our results offer early indication of widespread recurrent patterns in movement ecology that have consistent statistical signatures, regardless of taxon, body size, mode of movement, or environment. We further show that a simple set of metrics can be used to classify broad-scale movement patterns in disparate vertebrate taxa. Our comparative approach provides a general framework for quantifying and classifying animal movements, and facilitates new inquiries into relationships between movement syndromes and other ecological processes.},

   abstract = {In this review, stock identification methods used, resulting stock numbers and boundaries, and assessment and management context were explored for all 25 species managed by the Atlantic States Marine Fisheries Commission (ASMFC). This included invertebrates and vertebrates distributed between Maine and Florida, with a few species ranging across all these states and some ranging into the Gulf of Mexico and the Canadian Maritimes. The effects of larval dispersal or mixing of adults in the marine environment were evident. Marine and catadromous spawners were recognized and treated as a unit stock (e.g., northern shrimp Pandalus borealis, American Eel Anguilla rostrata, Atlantic menhaden Brevoortia tyrannus, Bluefish Pomatomus saltatrix, Tautog Tautoga onitis), a metapopulation (American lobster Homarus americanus, Atlantic Herring Clupea harengus), or two stocks, north and south of Cape Hatteras, a major biogeographic boundary, (Black Sea Bass Centropristis striata, Scup Stenotomus chrysops, Red Drum Sciaenops ocellatus, Summer Flounder Paralichthys dentatus). Estuarine and anadromous spawners were structured and managed at a finer spatial scale (horseshoe crab Limulus polyphemus, Atlantic Sturgeon Acipenser oxyrinchus, American Shad Alosa sapidissima and the river herrings Blueback Herring A. aestivalis and Alewife A. pseudoharengus, and Spotted Seatrout Cynoscion nebulosus). A broad suite of stock identification methods have been applied to ASMFC species and reviewed here in five categories: life history traits, other phenotypic traits, genetic traits, natural marks, and applied marks. An interdisciplinary mix of methods has been achieved for a few species (Striped Bass Morone saxatilis, Winter Flounder Pseudopleuronectes americanus), but only a few or no stock identification methods have been applied to others (Spiny Dogfish Squalus acanthias, Hickory Shad A. mediocris, Spot Leiostomus xanthurus, Spanish Mackerel Scomberomorus maculatus). Clinal phenotypic variation has contributed to several long-standing debates about stock structure; some of these have been recently reevaluated as a unit stock (Atlantic Croaker Micropogonias undulatus, Weakfish Cynoscion regalis), and others are still debated. For some ASMFC species, other priorities (e.g., bycatch) dominate the uncertainty of the assessment or management process. Otherwise, stock identification remains a research priority for most of these species. Continued research of this subject should consider (1) research priorities tabulated by ASMFC review panels, (2) strategic use of interdisciplinary stock identification methods, (3) use of experiments or reaction norms to separate phenotypes from genotypes, (4) genetic surveys at a seascape scale, (5) demonstration of contingent (nongenetic) structure and its implications for management, and (6) simulation modeling. Obstacles to adopting finer-scale structure into assessments or management of ASMFC fisheries include: (1) multiple stock units are apparent but boundaries are not clear, (2) monitoring requirements for smaller areas or for mixed-stock catches are not cost effective, or (3) mixing rates within a metapopulation or across biogeographic boundaries are poorly described.Received May 8, 2013; accepted March 3, 2014. © 2014 American Fisheries Society 2014.},

In the United States, estimates of marine recreational catch and effort were recently revised for the time period 1981 and beyond, and for many species, the revised estimates were substantially higher than the original values. Here, the proportion of total landings that came from the recreational sector in the Southeast US Atlantic was quantified. The proportions for 22 oceanic species and for all species combined were computed, using a full time series of landings (1981–2016) and a more recent time series (1999–2016). For the full and recent time series, landings of most species (15/22 and 17/22, respectively) were dominated by the recreational sector. For all species combined, 71% of landings in the full time series were from the recreational sector, and 76% in the recent time series. Trend analysis indicated that most species had a stable or increasing proportion of landings from the recreational sector. In addition, stock assessments were conducted on four species, and the catch revisions increased the estimated scale of abundance and, in some cases, affected stock or fishery status. This work underscores the importance of recreational fishing for marine resource management.},

   abstract = {Fisheries are increasingly managed with involvement of fishers and other stakeholders; this approach is believed to create ownership and maximize stakeholder buy-in. Stakeholder involvement is critical where managers lack adequate knowledge, resources to gather additional information, or resources to implement management. Such ‘data-limited’ fisheries are of global import but face challenges to meeting management goals. Sustainable management of data-limited fisheries may be improved by decision support. This paper reports results of a field experiment testing the FishPath interactive decision-support software tool for data-limited fisheries (FishPath) and its influence on stakeholder buy-in to management. In Stage 1, participants were provided a hypothetical fishery that mimicked real-world data limitations, and a tailored shortlist of management options; participants did not interact with FishPath. In Stage 2, participants collectively input the fishery into FishPath; the tool output the same management options seen in Stage 1. In Stage 3, to assess the effect of expert support, participants were randomly assigned to control and treatment groups. The control group explored output without additional support, while the treatment group explored output with support from a FishPath expert. After each stage, participants were asked to rate: 1) their support for formal management of the fishery; 2) how easy or hard they expected management of the fishery to be; and 3) how effective they expected management of the fishery to be. FishPath use increased stakeholder participants’ perceptions of the ease and effectiveness of management at each stage of the experiment, although support for management was unchanged.},

Here we show that FMR can be estimated directly from the isotopic composition of carbon in fish otoliths (δ13Coto). We describe the relationship between δ13Coto values and oxygen consumption rate, and report results from laboratory experiments relating individual-level measurements of oxygen consumption rates to δ13Coto values in Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua). We apply our new δ13Coto metabolic proxy to existing δ13Coto data from wild cod and four deepwater fish species to test the validity of inferred FMR estimates. The δ13Coto metabolic proxy offers a new approach to study physiological ecology in free-ranging wild fishes. Otolith-based proxies for FMR are particularly promising as they allow retrospective assessment of time-integrated, individual-level FMR throughout an individual fish’s life history.},

   abstract = {Metabolic rate underpins our understanding of how species survive, reproduce and interact with their environment, but can be difficult to measure in wild fish. Stable carbon isotopes (δ13C) in ear stones (otoliths) of fish may reflect lifetime metabolic signatures but experimental validation is required to advance our understanding of the relationship. To this end, we reared juvenile Australasian snapper (Chrysophrys auratus), an iconic fishery species, at different temperatures and used intermittent-flow respirometry to calculate standard metabolic rate (SMR), maximum metabolic rate (MMR) and absolute aerobic scope (AAS). Subsequently, we analysed δ13C and oxygen isotopes (δ18O) in otoliths using isotope-ratio mass spectrometry. We found that under increasing temperatures, δ13C and δ18O significantly decreased, while SMR and MMR significantly increased. Negative logarithmic relationships were found between δ13C in otoliths and both SMR and MMR, while exponential decay curves were observed between proportions of metabolically sourced carbon in otoliths (Moto) and both measured and theoretical SMR.We show that basal energy for subsistence living and activity metabolism, both core components of field metabolic rates, contribute towards incorporation of δ13C into otoliths and support the use of δ13C as a metabolic proxy in field settings. The functional shapes of the logarithmic and exponential decay curves indicated that physiological thresholds regulate relationships between δ13C and metabolic rates due to upper thresholds of Moto. Here, we present quantitative experimental evidence to support the development of an otolithbased metabolic proxy, which could be a powerful tool in reconstructing lifetime biological trends in wild fish.},

Otolith core-to-edge Sr/Ca and Ba/Ca profiles were determined by LA-ICP-MS, while the otolith 87Sr/86Sr data set was taken from literature. The predictive classification by rivers according to water Sr/Ca, Ba/Ca and 87Sr/86Sr ratios (92.5%) was higher than that based solely on 87Sr/86Sr (58%), with classification that reached 100% for several rivers. Unlike Ba/Ca, a significant relationship (R2 = 0.94, p < 0.05) was found between otolith edge and water Sr/Ca, suggesting that this could be an efficient movement indicator for P. lineatus.

   abstract = {Rationale: Otolith strontium:calcium (Sr:Ca) ratios have been extensively used to study fish migration across a river, estuary and ocean at each life stage. However, otolith Sr:Ca ratios only explain partial variations in salinity and quantitative reconstruction of salinity history of fishes remains a challenge. Using a euryhaline fish Lateolabrax japonicus as an example, this study demonstrated an isotopic method of quantitatively reconstructing the salinity histories and habitat uses of the fish. Methods: Otolith oxygen stable isotopic ratios (δ18Ooto values) were measured using a mass spectrometer for subsamples sequentially milled from the otolith core to the edge, and otolith Sr:Ca ratios were measured by an electron probe microanalyzer for the comparison. The mean water temperature within the studied area in the time period of each milled subsample was estimated from the Copernicus database. Based on an isotopic fractionation equation, each δ18Ooto value and water temperature pair determined the water δ18O value, which was then converted into salinity using published linear equations or an equation that was newly generated for this study. Results: Individual fish clearly revealed different preferences in habitat use. The retrospectively reconstructed salinity history indicated that most L. japonicus inhabit and can spawn in seawater as well as in brackish estuaries. Few fish lived in freshwater during the young stage based on the analysis of δ18Ooto profiles; however, otolith Sr:Ca ratios can only reveal freshwater residence and cannot distinguish residence in brackish water or seawater. Conclusions: This study demonstrated that otolith temporal microstructure and δ18Ooto values are well-suited approaches for quantitative reconstruction of salinity histories of the fish. This method can improve the understanding of the habitat uses of other fishes inhabiting diverse habitats among the rivers, estuaries and oceans.},

The salinity histories of 3 species of estuarine mangrove fishes, often dominant in tropical East Asian estuaries, viz. the apogonid Fibramia amboinensis, the pomacentrid Neopomacentrus taeniurus and the terapontid Terapon jarbua, were examined. The δ18Ootolith ranges of -5.4 to -2.3‰ for F. amboinensis and -3.7 to -2.3‰ for N. taeniurus corresponded to 6 to 30 psu and 19 to 30 psu, respectively, when compared to the 2 extreme salinity values of the reference fishes. Terapon jarbua, in contrast, exhibited a δ18Ootolith range of -3.0 to -1.8‰, corresponding to 25 to 34 psu. Field observations in other studies have indicated that F. amboinensis and N. taeniurus may be resident species, hovering near mangrove roots and tolerating a variable salinity environment, whereas T. jarbua may be a vagile species that can move to areas of preferred higher salinity conditions. Such behavioral ecologies are largely consistent with the salinity histories reconstructed from δ18Ootolith data. These results suggest that F. amboinensis and N. taeniurus may be estuarine resident fishes, whereas T. jarbua may be a marine migrant.},

   abstract = {A procedure is presented for incorporating catch totals by both weight and numbers in stock assessment. Their ratio is the weight of an average harvested individual which, in turn, reflects mean mortality rate. The model is age-based and requires, as input, a vector of average age-specific weights in the catch. The model developed for the South Australian rock lobster (Jasus edwardsii) fishery assumes steady state, constant fishing mortality on all age classes and a natural mortality rate equal to 0.1. Also explicit are reduced vulnerability of recruitment-aged lobsters and incidental mortality of lobsters below the legal minimum size. The solution yields estimates of average exploitation rate and yearly recruitment. These give (absolute) age-specific population numbers in the fishable stock. Exploitation rates were estimated for statistical reporting blocks in South Australia using this catch weight-numbers (qR) method and, for comparison, that of Beverton and Holt employing mean length. Each method was also tested with simulated data, the former yielding estimates of lower variance and bias. In practice, counting individuals captured is likely to require less time and to yield lower measurement error than measuring lengths. This method thus offers the possibility for improved precision and accuracy at lower cost.},

This symposium illustrated that fisheries science is now working at multiple scales and on all dimensions of socio-ecosystems (ecological, political, sociological, and economic), with a great diversity of approaches and taking into account different levels of complexity while acknowledging diverse sources of uncertainty. We argue that we should go one step further and call for a protean fisheries science to address the deteriorated states of aquatic ecosystems caused by anthropogenic pressures. Protean science is constantly evolving to meet emerging issues, while improving its coherence and integration capacity in its complexity. This science must be nourished by multiple approaches and be capable of addressing all organizational scales, from individual fish or fishermen up to the entire ecosystem, include society, its economy and the services it derives from aquatic systems. Such a protean science is required to address the complexity of ecosystem functioning and of the impacts of anthropogenic pressures.},

After spending nearly a decade addressing the recommendations, NMFS requested another evaluation of its modified survey program (MRIP).

In the United States, estimates of marine recreational catch and effort were recently revised for the time period 1981 and beyond, and for many species, the revised estimates were substantially higher than the original values. Here, the proportion of total landings that came from the recreational sector in the Southeast US Atlantic was quantified. The proportions for 22 oceanic species and for all species combined were computed, using a full time series of landings (1981–2016) and a more recent time series (1999–2016). For the full and recent time series, landings of most species (15/22 and 17/22, respectively) were dominated by the recreational sector. For all species combined, 71% of landings in the full time series were from the recreational sector, and 76% in the recent time series. Trend analysis indicated that most species had a stable or increasing proportion of landings from the recreational sector. In addition, stock assessments were conducted on four species, and the catch revisions increased the estimated scale of abundance and, in some cases, affected stock or fishery status. This work underscores the importance of recreational fishing for marine resource management.},

   abstract = {The northern Gulf of Mexico is a complex and very productive coastal river-dominated system that receives freshwater from numerous rivers including the Mississippi River. The dynamics of coastal ecosystems in the northern Gulf of Mexico are greatly influenced by the freshwater discharge but also by the high nutrient loads carried by the Mississippi River that lead to the seasonal development of one of the largest coastal hypoxic areas. Constraining the origin and fate of the freshwater inputs in the northern Gulf of Mexico will help increase understanding the physical and biogeochemical processes occurring in this region. Here, we focus on investigating the extent of the Mississippi River plume on both sides of the Mississippi River Delta: to the east in the Mississippi Bight, and to the west over the Louisiana Shelf. We determined the water isotopic signature (δ18O and δD) along with salinity of the different river plumes and performed a river mixing model on the coastal waters. Our findings provide useful information to better understand the functioning of the northern Gulf of Mexico ecosystem. In particular, the development of hypoxia is often attributed to the nutrient load of the Mississippi River, yet the Mississippi River seemed to have a limited influence on the Mississippi Bight. That is, the dominant source of freshwater in the Bight was supplied by local Mississippi/Alabama rivers. Furthermore, the water isotope mixing model showed that the source of freshwater to the Louisiana Shelf was dominated by the Atchafalaya River in summer, and by the Mississippi River during non-summer seasons. This pattern is consistent with the general shelf circulation that reverses in summer, but could not have been shown solely by the use of salinity.},

The δ18O values of seawater in this area show significant variability with heavy isotope enrichment relatively to groundwater. The δD and δ18O data also confirmed that submarine groundwater discharge (SGD) originated from meteoric water and were mixed with seawater. Due to an overdraft of groundwater, seawater has intruded inwardly through the offshore outcrops for both the unconfined and confined aquifers at a depth of 300m. However, δ18O-depleted layer is found along deep parts of Kaoping Canyon. This result provides evidence for SGD in this region. This phenomenon is also reflected in depleted δ13CDIC and lower Δ14C values in deep canyon water than in adjacent seawater, and indicating that the discharge zone extends over a considerable distance to the offshore area (∼25km). Based on these three parameters (δ18O, δ13CDIC and Δ14C), we used two end-member mixing model to estimate that fresh submarine groundwater constitute. The submarine fresh groundwater contributed about 3%, and the estimated submarine fresh groundwater discharge was calculated as 4.5×109m3 per year. This result is comparable with groundwater annual loss in the Pingtung Plain. As documented by the isotopic composition of the collected samples, detailed results show that SGD in the Pingtung coastal zone raises a potential environmental concern and provides implication for the management of groundwater resource in the region. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

   abstract = {Reconstruction of continental palaeoclimate and palaeohydrology is currently hampered by limited information about isotopic patterns in the modern hydrologic cycle. To remedy this situation and to provide baseline data for other isotope hydrology studies, more than 4800, depth- and width-integrated, stream samples from 391 selected sites within the USGS National Stream Quality Accounting Network (NASQAN) and Hydrologic Benchmark Network (HBN) were analysed for δ18 and δ2H (http://water.usgs.gov/pubs/ofr/ofr00-160/pdf/ofr00-160.pdf). Each site was sampled bimonthly or quarterly for 2.5 to 3 years between 1984 and 1987. The ability of this dataset to serve as a proxy for the isotopic composition of modern precipitation in the USA is supported by the excellent agreement between the river dataset and the isotopic compositions of adjacent precipitation monitoring sites, the strong spatial coherence of the distributions of δ18O and δ2H, the good correlations of the isotopic compositions with climatic parameters, and the good agreement between the 'national' meteoric water line (MWL) generated from unweighted analyses of samples from the 48 contiguous states of δ2H = 8.11δ18 O + 8.99 (r2 = 0.98) and the unweighted global MWL of sites from the Global Network for Isotopes in Precipitation (GNIP) of the International Atomic Energy Agency and the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) of δ2H = 8.17δ18 O + 10.35. The national MWL is composed of water samples that arise in diverse local conditions where the local meteoric water lines (LMWLs) usually have much lower slopes. Adjacent sites often have similar LMWLs, allowing the datasets to be combined into regional MWLs. The slopes of regional MWLs probably reflect the humidity of the local air mass, which imparts a distinctive evaporative isotopic signature to rainfall and hence to stream samples. Deuterium excess values range from 6 to 15‰ in the eastern half of the USA, along the northwest coast and on the Colorado Plateau. In the rest of the USA, these values range from -2 to 6‰, with strong spatial correlations with regional aridity. The river samples have successfully integrated the spatial variability in the meteorological cycle and provide the best available dataset on the spatial distributions of δ18 O and δ2 H values of meteoric waters in the USA.},

We analysed ~2 million detections for 23 species, ranging from reef fish such as Nassau grouper (Epinephelus striatus, Serranidae) to migratory apex predators such as white sharks (Carcharodon carcharias, Lamnidae). To facilitate comparisons across species, we used an eco-evolutionary movement strategy framework that identified measurable movement traits and their proximate and ultimate drivers. Detectability was species-specific and quantified with a detection potential index. Life stages detected in the study area varied by species and residency varied with life stage. Four annual movement types were identified as follows: high site-fidelity residents, range residents, seasonal migrants and general migrants. The endangered smalltooth sawfish (Pristis pectinata, Pristidae), a seasonal migrant, exhibited the greatest within-ecosystem connectivity. Site attachment, stopover and deep-water migration behaviours differed between individuals, species and annual movement types. All apex predators were migratory. General migrants were significantly larger than fish in the other movement types, a life-history and movement trait combination that is common but not exclusive, as many small pelagics also migrate. Most teleosts exhibited movements associated with spawning. As concerns grow over habitat and biodiversity loss, multispecies movescapes, such as presented here, are expected to play an increasingly important role in informing ecosystem-based and non-extractive fisheries management strategies.},

Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-α-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 Å for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21% with default Glide SP settings to 58% with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63% success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40% of peptides were docked successfully.

No suitable status information was found for 11% (MSC) to 53% (FOS) of the certified stocks. For the stocks with available status information, 19% (FOS) to 31% (MSC) had overfished stock sizes and were subject to ongoing overfishing. An analysis of legal implications of certification of overfished stocks suggests that a certifying body cannot be held liable for a violation of internationally agreed standards unless the domestic law of its home country so regulates. States may ban the import of fish products from overfished stocks, but only in very specific cases. Possible causes for the certification of overfished stocks are discussed and recommendations are given on how the certifiers could improve their performance. The study concludes that it is still reasonable to buy certified seafood, because the percentage of moderately exploited, healthy stocks is 3-4 times higher in certified than in non-certified seafood. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

Many organizations produce measures of the extent of overfishing, typically classifying individual stocks as overfished if they are below some biomass threshold. Most agencies then report their overall status (i.e. percentage overfished, fully exploited, etc.) by giving equal weight to all stocks, regardless of stock size or potential yield. We review the range of indices used to assess overfishing levels and apply them to the data from US fisheries to show how they depict very different performance of fisheries. Given that overfishing is a concept imbedded in the maximization of long-term harvest, we evaluate how well these indices reflect the extent to which fisheries have maximized sustainable yield. Indices that are weighted by the potential yield of the stock much better reflect the regional performance of fisheries but are still limited by the arbitrary use of a threshold abundance. For the United States, weighting by maximum sustainable yield or value suggests that the losses from overfishing are less than existing methods using equal weighting and that underfishing is much more common than overfishing.},

The existence of behavioral syndromes focuses the attention of behavioral ecologists on limited (less than optimal) behavioral plasticity and behavioral carryovers across situations, rather than on optimal plasticity in each isolated situation. Behavioral syndromes can explain behaviors that appear strikingly non-adaptive in an isolated context (e.g. inappropriately high activity when predators are present, or excessive sexual cannibalism). Behavioral syndromes can also help to explain the maintenance of individual variation in behavioral types, a phenomenon that is ubiquitous, but often ignored. Recent studies suggest that the behavioral type of an individual, population or species can have important ecological and evolutionary implications, including major effects on species distributions, on the relative tendencies of species to be invasive or to respond well to environmental change, and on speciation rates. Although most studies of behavioral syndromes to date have focused on a few organisms, mainly in the laboratory, further work on other species, particularly in the field, should yield numerous new insights.},

   abstract = {Ontogenetic niche shifts are common among animals, yet most studies only investigate niche shifts at the population level, which may overlook considerable differences among individuals in the timing and dynamics of these shifts. Such divergent behaviors within size-/age-classes have important implications for the roles a population—and specific age-classes—play in their respective ecosystem(s). Using acoustic telemetry, we tracked the movements of juvenile bull sharks in the Shark River Estuary of Everglades National Park, Florida, and found that sharks increased their use of marine microhabitats with age to take advantage of more abundant resources, but continued to use freshwater and estuarine microhabitats as refuges from marine predators. Within this population-level ontogenetic niche shift, however, movement patterns varied among individual sharks, with 47 % of sharks exhibiting condition-dependent habitat use and 53 % appearing risk-averse regardless of body condition. Among sharks older than age 0, fifty percent made regular movements between adjacent regions of the estuary, while the other half made less predictable movements that often featured long-term residence in specific regions. Individual differences were apparently shaped by both intrinsic and extrinsic factors, including individual responses to food-risk trade-offs and body condition. These differences appear to develop early in the lives of bull sharks, and persist throughout their residencies in nursery habitats. The widespread occurrence of intraspecific variation in behavior among mobile taxa suggests it is important in shaping population dynamics of at least some species, and elucidating the contexts and timing in which it develops and persists is important for understanding its role within communities.},

However, considerable uncertainties about future ecological changes and ensuing socio-economic impacts impede the identification of societal adaptation strategies. In a case study from the Barents Sea and Northern Norwegian Sea region, we integrated stakeholder perceptions of ecological changes and their significance for societies with the current state of scientific knowledge, to investigate the marine-human system under climate change and identify societal adaptation options. Stakeholders were engaged through personal interviews, two local workshops, and a web based survey, identifying the most relevant ecosystem services potentially impacted and developing an integrated system dynamics model which links climate change scenarios to the response of relevant species. Stakeholder perceptions of temperature-dependent multiannual fluctuations of fish stocks, interactions among fish, marine mammal, and seabird populations, and ecological processes such as primary production are represented in the model. The model was used for a discourse-based stakeholder evaluation of potential ecosystem changes under ocean warming and acidification scenarios, identifying shifts in ecosystem service provision and discussing associated societal adaptation options. The results pointed to differences in adaptive capacity among user groups. Small-scale fishers and tourism businesses are potentially more affected by changing spatial distribution and local declines in marine species than industrial fisheries. Changes in biodiversity, especially extinctions of polar species, and ecosystem functioning were a concern from an environmental conservation viewpoint. When considering potential additional impacts of ocean acidification, changes observed in the model projections were more uniformly valued as negative, and associated with an increased potential for conflicts among user groups. The stakeholder-informed ecosystem modeling approach has succeeded in driving a discussion and interchange among stakeholder groups and with scientists, integrating knowledge about climate change impacts in the social-ecological system and identifying important factors that shape societal responses. The approach can thus serve to improve governance of marine systems by incorporating knowledge about system dynamics and about societal uses and values.},

   abstract = {In the Baltic Sea region, salmon are valued for the ecological, economic, and cultural benefits they provide. However, these fish are threatened due to historical overfishing, disease, and reduced access to spawning rivers. Climate change may pose another challenge for salmon management. Therefore, we conducted a problem-framing study to explore the effects climate change may have on salmon and the socio-ecological system they are embedded within. Addressing this emerging issue will require the cooperation of diverse stakeholders and the integration of their knowledge and values in a contentious management context. Therefore, we conducted this problem framing as a participatory process with stakeholders, whose mental models and questionnaire responses form the basis of this study. By framing the climate change problem in this way, we aim to provide a holistic understanding of the problem and incorporate stakeholder perspectives into the management process from an early stage to better address their concerns and establish common ground. We conclude that considering climate change is relevant for Baltic salmon management, although it may not be the most pressing threat facing these fish. Stakeholders disagree about whether climate change will harm or benefit salmon, when it will become a relevant issue in the Baltic context, and whether or not management efforts can mitigate any negative impacts climate change may have on salmon and their fishery. Nevertheless, by synthesizing the stakeholders' influence diagrams, we found 15 themes exemplifying: (1) how climate change may affect salmon, (2) goals for salmon management considering climate change, and (3) strategies for achieving those goals. Further, the stakeholders tended to focus on the riverine environment and the salmon life stages occurring therein, potentially indicating the perceived vulnerability of these life stages to climate change. Interestingly, however, the stakeholders tended to focus on traditional fishery management measures, like catch quotas, to meet their goals for these fish considering climate change. Further, social variables, like “politics,” “international cooperation,” and “employment” comprised a large proportion of the stakeholders' diagrams, demonstrating the importance of these factors for salmon management.},

   abstract = {Achieving inclusive value chain development is a challenging task due to the complex and dynamic nature of interconnected value chains and their social, economic, and ecological dimensions. While many policies and intervention options exist to upgrade value chains, there are fewer methods that can be used to understand and quantify the multidimensional impacts that value chain policies and interventions may have throughout the value chain. This paper addresses this methodological gap by employing a system dynamics (SD) modeling approach. SD models allow us to model and quantify the processes and relationships inherent in the value chain through simulations, serving as a policy laboratory for the empirical assessment of intervention options. An SD model of the Matiguás dairy value chain in Nicaragua was developed and tested through a participatory modeling process. Our research tested and evaluated the short-, medium-, and long-term impacts of specific interventions and policies in the Matiguás dairy value chain with the goal of strengthening the competitiveness and inclusion of small- and medium-scale producers. These interventions centered on improving the feeding system, which was identified by stakeholders as the critical constraint to competitiveness. The policy analysis reveals that both improved pastures and increased use of concentrates raise producer milk productivity by 5% and 11%, respectively in the long run, but are also expensive strategies for smallholder producers, leading to a reduction in profits relative to the baseline by 1% and 3%, respectively. Consequently, policymakers should identify strategies that help to reduce concentrate costs and support producers with investments in improved pasture, while also promoting training in pasture management skills. Indeed, in the long-run, model results reveal that investment and training in pasture management results in a 30% and 35% increase in milk production during the wet and dry season, respectively. Simulation results further highlighted that intensifying the feeding system to improve cow milk yields is mainly profitable in the long term, and thus requires a longer-term perspective by policymakers. The model provides a deeper understanding of the complex and dynamic nature of the Matiguás dairy value chain and the interactions between markets, coordination aspects, biophysical phenomena, and income. The system dynamics approach to value chain analysis further addresses a major analytical shortcoming in value chain analysis and provides decision makers with an improved platform for planning and policy formulation.},

   abstract = {Climate change affects the marine environment at all levels of governance. At a global level, researchers expect the projected increase in sea surface temperature to facilitate large changes in the marine food web, which in turn will affect both global fisheries and aquaculture. At the local level, government and stakeholders want to know whether and how this affects their local communities and their adaptive capacity in light of this. Research suggests that risk communication of the effects of changes in the marine food web suffers from stakeholders' short-term mentality and narrow boundaries. This in turn can lead to an underestimation of the potential risks associated with climate change. We explore this theory by mapping the perceptions of marine stakeholders in the region of Troms, Norway. We first developed cognitive maps in a workshop setting, and then used system conceptualization to analyze the feedback mechanisms of the system qualitatively using fuzzy cognitive mapping. We examined the outcomes and compared them for different scenarios using a simple MatLab script. Results demonstrated that stakeholders did not underestimate their risks to climate change. They were aware of environmental changes, and they perceived that a changing climate was the cause of this change, and that it was indeed affecting their livelihoods-and would continue to do so in the future.},

   abstract = {In the Baltic Sea region, salmon are valued for the ecological, economic, and cultural benefits they provide. However, these fish are threatened due to historical overfishing, disease, and reduced access to spawning rivers. Climate change may pose another challenge for salmon management. Therefore, we conducted a problem-framing study to explore the effects climate change may have on salmon and the socio-ecological system they are embedded within. Addressing this emerging issue will require the cooperation of diverse stakeholders and the integration of their knowledge and values in a contentious management context. Therefore, we conducted this problem framing as a participatory process with stakeholders, whose mental models and questionnaire responses form the basis of this study. By framing the climate change problem in this way, we aim to provide a holistic understanding of the problem and incorporate stakeholder perspectives into the management process from an early stage to better address their concerns and establish common ground. We conclude that considering climate change is relevant for Baltic salmon management, although it may not be the most pressing threat facing these fish. Stakeholders disagree about whether climate change will harm or benefit salmon, when it will become a relevant issue in the Baltic context, and whether or not management efforts can mitigate any negative impacts climate change may have on salmon and their fishery. Nevertheless, by synthesizing the stakeholders' influence diagrams, we found 15 themes exemplifying: (1) how climate change may affect salmon, (2) goals for salmon management considering climate change, and (3) strategies for achieving those goals. Further, the stakeholders tended to focus on the riverine environment and the salmon life stages occurring therein, potentially indicating the perceived vulnerability of these life stages to climate change. Interestingly, however, the stakeholders tended to focus on traditional fishery management measures, like catch quotas, to meet their goals for these fish considering climate change. Further, social variables, like “politics,” “international cooperation,” and “employment” comprised a large proportion of the stakeholders' diagrams, demonstrating the importance of these factors for salmon management.},

   abstract = {Climate change affects the marine environment at all levels of governance. At a global level, researchers expect the projected increase in sea surface temperature to facilitate large changes in the marine food web, which in turn will affect both global fisheries and aquaculture. At the local level, government and stakeholders want to know whether and how this affects their local communities and their adaptive capacity in light of this. Research suggests that risk communication of the effects of changes in the marine food web suffers from stakeholders' short-term mentality and narrow boundaries. This in turn can lead to an underestimation of the potential risks associated with climate change. We explore this theory by mapping the perceptions of marine stakeholders in the region of Troms, Norway. We first developed cognitive maps in a workshop setting, and then used system conceptualization to analyze the feedback mechanisms of the system qualitatively using fuzzy cognitive mapping. We examined the outcomes and compared them for different scenarios using a simple MatLab script. Results demonstrated that stakeholders did not underestimate their risks to climate change. They were aware of environmental changes, and they perceived that a changing climate was the cause of this change, and that it was indeed affecting their livelihoods-and would continue to do so in the future.},

   abstract = {Achieving inclusive value chain development is a challenging task due to the complex and dynamic nature of interconnected value chains and their social, economic, and ecological dimensions. While many policies and intervention options exist to upgrade value chains, there are fewer methods that can be used to understand and quantify the multidimensional impacts that value chain policies and interventions may have throughout the value chain. This paper addresses this methodological gap by employing a system dynamics (SD) modeling approach. SD models allow us to model and quantify the processes and relationships inherent in the value chain through simulations, serving as a policy laboratory for the empirical assessment of intervention options. An SD model of the Matiguás dairy value chain in Nicaragua was developed and tested through a participatory modeling process. Our research tested and evaluated the short-, medium-, and long-term impacts of specific interventions and policies in the Matiguás dairy value chain with the goal of strengthening the competitiveness and inclusion of small- and medium-scale producers. These interventions centered on improving the feeding system, which was identified by stakeholders as the critical constraint to competitiveness. The policy analysis reveals that both improved pastures and increased use of concentrates raise producer milk productivity by 5% and 11%, respectively in the long run, but are also expensive strategies for smallholder producers, leading to a reduction in profits relative to the baseline by 1% and 3%, respectively. Consequently, policymakers should identify strategies that help to reduce concentrate costs and support producers with investments in improved pasture, while also promoting training in pasture management skills. Indeed, in the long-run, model results reveal that investment and training in pasture management results in a 30% and 35% increase in milk production during the wet and dry season, respectively. Simulation results further highlighted that intensifying the feeding system to improve cow milk yields is mainly profitable in the long term, and thus requires a longer-term perspective by policymakers. The model provides a deeper understanding of the complex and dynamic nature of the Matiguás dairy value chain and the interactions between markets, coordination aspects, biophysical phenomena, and income. The system dynamics approach to value chain analysis further addresses a major analytical shortcoming in value chain analysis and provides decision makers with an improved platform for planning and policy formulation.},

   abstract = {Site fidelity and movement of red snapper, Lutjanus campechanus, were estimated from a tagging study conducted off the coast of Alabama from March 1995 to January 1997. Red snapper were caught using rod and reel over nine artificial reef sites, with three reefs each located at 21-m, 27-m, and 32-m depths. During the study, 1,604 fish were tagged, and 174 recaptures were made of 167 individuals. On 4 October 1995, the eye of Hurricane Opal passed within 40 km of the artificial reef sites. When recaptures were stratified according to whether or not they were at liberty during Opal, storm effect was the most significant factor in predicting the likelihood of movement and magnitude of movement by tagged red snapper. Eighty percent of recaptured red snapper that were not at liberty during Opal were recaptured at their site of release. Fish that were at liberty during Opal, however, had a significantly higher likelihood of movement away from their site of release (P < 0.001). These fish also moved significantly further than those that were not at liberty during Opal (P < 0.001). Fish that were at liberty during Opal moved a mean distance (± SE) of 32.6 km (± 6.81), compared to a mean distance (± SE) of 2.5 km (± 1.10) for fish that were tagged and recaptured before Opal, and a mean distance (± SE) of 1.7 km (± 0.43) for fish that were tagged and recaptured after Opal. Heretofore, it has generally been accepted that adult red snapper demonstrate strong site fidelity and genetic homogeneity in the stock was hypothesized to result from larval drift or due to historic mixing on longer time scales. This study documents movement of adult red snapper on spatial scales that would facilitate stock mixing and implicates large-scale climatic events, such as hurricanes, as important factors in stock mixing dynamics.},

   abstract = {Objective: Ordinary least squares (OLS) regression, commonly called linear regression, is often used to assess, or adjust for, the relationship between a continuous independent variable and the mean of a continuous dependent variable, implicitly assuming a linear relationship between them. Linearity may not hold, however, and analyzing the mean of the dependent variable may not capture the full nature of such relationships. Our goal is to demonstrate how combined use of quantile regression and restricted cubic splines (RCS) can reveal the true nature and complexity of relationships between continuous variables. Study Design and Setting: We provide a review of methodologic concepts, followed by two examples using real data sets. In the first example, we analyzed the relationship between cognition and disease duration in multiple sclerosis. In the second example, we analyzed the relationship between length of stay (LOS) and severity of illness in the intensive care unit (ICU). Results: In both examples, quantile regression showed that the relationship between the variables of interest was heterogeneous. In the second example, RCS uncovered nonlinearity of the relationship between severity of illness and length of stay. Conclusion: Together, quantile regression and RCS are a powerful combination for exploring relationships between continuous variables. © 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

   abstract = {To accurately estimate population dynamics and viability, structured population models account for among-individual differences in demographic parameters that are related to individual state. In the widely used matrix models, such differences are incorporated in terms of discrete state categories, whereas integral projection models (IPMs) use continuous state variables to avoid artificial classes. In IPMs, and sometimes also in matrix models, parameterization is based on regressions that do not always model nonlinear relationships between demographic parameters and state variables. We stress the importance of testing for nonlinearity and propose using restricted cubic splines in order to allow for a wide variety of relationships in regressions and demographic models. For the plant Borderea pyrenaica, we found that vital rate relationships with size and age were nonlinear and that the parameterization method had large effects on predicted population growth rates, k (linear IPM, 0.95; nonlinear IPMs, 1.00; matrix model, 0.96). Our results suggest that restricted cubic spline models are more reliable than linear or polynomial models. Because even weak nonlinearity in relationships between vital rates and state variables can have large effects on model predictions, we suggest that restricted cubic regression splines should be considered for parameterizing models of population dynamics whenever linearity cannot be assumed.},

   abstract = {How can uncertain fisheries science be linked with good governance processes, thereby increasing fisheries management legitimacy and effectiveness? Reducing the uncertainties around scientific models has long been perceived as the cure of the fisheries management problem. There is however increasing recognition that uncertainty in the numbers will remain. A lack of transparency with respect to these uncertainties can damage the credibility of science. The EU Commission's proposal for a reformed Common Fisheries Policy calls for more self-management for the fishing industry by increasing fishers' involvement in the planning and execution of policies and boosting the role of fishers' organisations. One way of higher transparency and improved participation is to include stakeholders in the modelling process itself. The JAKFISH project (Judgment And Knowledge in Fisheries Involving StakeHolders) invited fisheries stakeholders to participate in the process of framing the management problem, and to give input and evaluate the scientific models that are used to provide fisheries management advice. JAKFISH investigated various tools to assess and communicate uncertainty around fish stock assessments and fisheries management. Here, a synthesis is presented of the participatory work carried out in four European fishery case studies (Western Baltic herring, North Sea Nephrops, Central Baltic Herring and Mediterranean swordfish), focussing on the uncertainty tools used, the stakeholders' responses to these, and the lessons learnt. It is concluded that participatory modelling has the potential to facilitate and structure discussions between scientists and stakeholders about uncertainties and the quality of the knowledge base. It can also contribute to collective learning, increase legitimacy, and advance scientific understanding. However, when approaching real-life situations, modelling should not be seen as the priority objective. Rather, the crucial step in a science-stakeholder collaboration is the joint problem framing in an open, transparent way. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

   abstract = {There has been a proliferation of coupled social-ecological systems (SES) models created and published in recent years. However, the degree of coupling between natural and social systems varies widely across the different coupled models and is often a function of the disciplinary background of the team conducting the research. This manuscript examines models developed for and used by NOAA Fisheries in support of Ecosystem Based Fisheries Management (EBFM) in the United States. It provides resource managers and interdisciplinary scientists insights on the strengths and weaknesses of the most commonly used SES models: end-to-end models, conceptual models, bioeconomic models, management strategy evaluations (MSEs), fisher behavior models, integrated social vulnerability models, and regional economic impact models. These model types are not unique to the literature, but allow us to differentiate between one-way coupled models – where outputs from one model are inputs into a second model of another discipline with no feedback to the first model, and two-way coupled models – where there are linkages between the natural and social system models. For a model to provide useful strategic or tactical advice, it should only be coupled to the degree necessary to understand the important dynamics/responses of the system and to create management-relevant performance metrics or potential risks from an (in)action. However, one key finding is to not wait to integrate! This paper highlights the importance of “when” the coupling happens, as timing affects the ability to fully address management questions and multi-sectoral usage conflicts that consider the full SES for EBFM or ecosystem based management (EBM) more generally.},

This investigation quantified the loss of landings attributed to harbour seal, Phoca vitulina L., and spiny dogfish, Squalus acanthias L., depredation in the Georges Bank, Massachusetts, USA gillnet fishery. Approximately 1361kg (2.38%) of fish was discarded from a total possible catch weight of nearly 57300kg because it was unsalable following depredation. Spiny dogfish accounted for 1134kg (1.98%), and harbour seal accounted for 227kg (0.40%) of discards. This represented an estimated US$2250 loss in profits from a total possible catch value of almost US$61800, signifying a 3.64% market-value loss during the assessment period. These results suggest that discarding due to harbour seal and spiny dogfish depredation results in a relatively small market loss to fishers, although additional information and research is needed before this can be confirmed. This study is the first on this subject in the fishery and provides baseline information on depredation rates that could be useful if harbour seal and spiny dogfish populations continue to increase. © 2012 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.},

The increase in depredation is of concern for small stocks of cetaceans because interactions with fishing gear can lead to serious injury or mortality through entanglement or ingestion. Using long-term data sets available for the bottlenose dolphin (Tursiops truncatus) community in Sarasota Bay, Florida, we investigated recreational fishing gear interactions by (1) examining temporal patterns in depredation and associated behaviors from 2000 to 2007; (2) quantifying the behavior of dolphins that depredate or engage in associated behaviors; and (3) identifying factors associated with the rise in depredation locally. The number of incidents of dolphins (primarily adult males) interacting with recreational anglers and boaters increased following 2004. Depredation and associated behaviors increased during red tide lags and tourist seasons during times of prey depletion and heightened angler and boater activity. Dolphins with a history of fishing gear interactions shifted away from natural activity patterns and were more likely to be within 50 m of fishing lines. Recreational fishing gear interactions were attributed to a two percent population decline in Sarasota Bay in 2006 and need to be considered along with other cumulative human impacts in the development of conservation measures for dolphins. © 2010 by the Society for Marine Mammalogy.},

   abstract = {Modern fisheries operate in circumstances of contested demands on resources from multiple stakeholders and management under different legislative jurisdictions. Formal management strategy evaluation (MSE) facilitates quantitative assessment of strengths and weaknesses of alternative management strategies designed to meet multiple agenda. The reef line fishery on the Great Barrier Reef (GBR, Australia) operates under multiple jurisdictions in a World Heritage Area with diverse stakeholder agenda for conservation and commercial and recreational harvest. We worked with stakeholders to identify: (i) specific objectives; (ii) alternative management strategies; and (iii) performance indicators to compare likelihoods of meeting economic, recreational and stock objectives for the fishery and conservation objectives for the effects of line fishing on the GBR. Stakeholders identified objectives and associated performance indicators in four categories, for: (1) conservation of unfished populations; (2) the harvestable stock; (3) economic performance of the fishery; (4) satisfaction of recreational fishers. We used a metapopulation and fishing simulation model (ELFSim) to assess the effects of three effort regimes in combination with three area closure regimes on the primary target species, common coral trout (Plectropomus leopardus). The nine management strategies were also compared with a zero fishing scenario for reference. Controlling fishing effort most improved prospects of meeting economic, stock and recreational satisfaction objectives for the fishery. Nine of ten performance indicators across all stakeholder objectives were maximised when fishing effort was at the lowest non-zero level tested. Maximising the area closed to fishing with reduced fishing effort was most likely to achieve the conservation objectives. This research provides a case study of productive engagement with stakeholders to address fisheries and conservation management needs in a multi-sectoral spatial management context. Together, we provided a common currency (the prospect of meeting quantified objectives) for impartial evaluation of performance of alternative management options against diverse and often competing stakeholder agenda. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

As technical solutions to this conflict are limited and difficult to implement, this study aimed to identify fishing practices that could reduce odontocete depredation, with a focus on killer whales (Orcinus orca) interacting with Patagonian toothfish (Dissostichus eleginoides) longliners off the Crozet islands. Data collected by fishery observers from 6013 longline sets between 2003 and 2013 allowed us to statistically detect the significant influence of five operational variables using GLMMs. The probability of interactions between vessels and killer whales was decreased by (i) the number of vessels operating simultaneously in the area: the limited number of depredating killer whales may induce a dilution effect with increased fleet size, and (ii) depth of longline sets: vessels operating in shallow waters may be more accessible to whales that are initially distributed on peri-insular shelves. The cpue was negatively influenced by (iii) length of longlines: longer sets may provide killer whales access to a greater proportion of hooked fish per set, and positively influenced by (iv) hauling speed: increased speed may shorten the time during which toothfish are accessible to whales during hauling. The time it takes for killer whales to reach vessels was positively correlated to (v) the distance travelled between longline sets with an estimated threshold of 100 km beyond which whales seem to temporarily lose track of vessels. These findings provide insightful guidelines about what fishing strategy to adopt given these variables to reduce killer whale depredation here and in similar situations elsewhere. To a greater extent, this study is illustrative of how collaborative work with fishermen in a fully controlled fishery framework may lead to the definition of cost-limited and easy-to-implement mitigation solutions when facing such human-wildlife conflict.},

   abstract = {The non-target bycatch of sharks in pelagic longline (PLL) fisheries represents a potential source of compromise to shark populations worldwide. Moreover, shark bycatch and depredation (damage inflicted on gear, bait, and catch) complicates management of sharks and other species, and can undermine the operations and financial interests of the pelagic longline industry. Thus, deducing means to reduce shark interactions is in the best interest of multiple stakeholder groups. Prior to doing so, however, the extent, cause and effect of these interactions must be better understood. In this review we address or conduct the following in relation to the U.S. Atlantic, Gulf of Mexico and Caribbean PLL fishery: (1) U.S. management governing shark interactions in the Atlantic; (2) the primary species encountered and historical shark catch data associated with PLL fishing in the Atlantic; (3) a historical comparison of area-specific shark species catch records between the two primary sources of shark catch data in this fishery; (4) the conditions and dynamics that dictate shark interactions in this fishery, and potential means to reduce these interactions, and; (5) a synthesis of the estimated impacts of this fishery on shark populations relative to other fisheries in the Atlantic. As has been found in other PLL fisheries, the blue shark (Prionace glauca) is clearly the shark species most commonly encountered in this fishery in the Atlantic, and receives the majority of attention in this review. U.S. management areas with high relative shark species diversities had a greater divergence in historical shark species percent-compositions between data sources (Pelagic Observer Program versus mandatory pelagic Logbook databases); this complicates the ability to conclude which species are most impacted by PLL fishing in those areas. The current fishing effort by the U.S. PLL fleet is small compared to that of PLL fishing targeting sharks in the Atlantic by non-U.S. fleets, and therefore poses a comparatively lower threat to the stability of Atlantic shark populations. However, incidental shark encounters are inevitable in U.S. Atlantic PLL fishing operations. Thus, it is in the best interest of all stakeholders in the Atlantic to better understand the extent and conditions governing these interactions, and to explore methods to reduce both their occurrence and those aspects leading to higher rates of incidental shark mortality. © Springer Science+Business Media B.V. 2008.},

   abstract = {Demersal and pelagic longline fisheries involve frequent and geographically widespread interactions with many individuals, populations, and species of marine mammals. Animals sometimes suffer mortality and serious injury following these interactions, attracted mainly to longlines as a source of food. This depredating behaviour can have serious consequences for fishermen, especially when they lose valuable catch and face other associated operational and regulatory challenges. Using input from a group of international experts in the science, fishing industry, and government sectors, we produced a list of methods for mitigating depredation and bycatch of marine mammals in longline fisheries, collectively assessed their potential as a solution, and determined priorities for further research. The intention of this review is to help synthesize our current understanding about potential solutions, to provide an introduction to the articles that appear in this themed set of the ICES Journal of Marine Science, and to help fishermen, fisheries managers, and research scientists advance solutions to this global problem.},

   abstract = {Abstract: Operational interactions between odontocetes (i.e., toothed whales) and longline gear are a global phenomenon that may threaten the conservation of odontocete populations and the economic viability of longline fisheries. This review attempts to define the issue, summarize the trends and geographical extent of its occurrence over the last half century, explore the potential impact on odontocetes and on fisheries, and describe potential acoustic and physical mitigation solutions. Reports of odontocete bycatch rates are highly variable (between 0.002 and 0.231 individuals killed per set) and at least 20 species may be involved. Information about marine mammal population size, migration patterns and life history characteristics are scarce, although at least one population may be in decline due to losses attributable to longline bycatch. Information about the financial impact of depredation on pelagic longline fisheries is also scarce, although estimates of daily fleet-wide losses range between US$1,034 and US$8,495 (overall fleet income was not reported). Such biological and financial losses may be unsustainable. Recent developments in acoustic and physical mitigation technologies have yielded mixed results. Acoustic mitigation technologies have no moving parts, although require complex electronics. To date, they are insufficiently developed and their efficacy has been difficult to assess. Physical mitigation technologies generally require complex moving parts, although they are relatively simple to develop and assess. Further development and testing remains necessary before widespread implementation would be possible. Development of these approaches should be prioritized and a "toolbox" of various strategies and solutions should be compiled, because a single panacea to the problem is unlikely to emerge. © 2012 by the Society for Marine Mammalogy.},

   abstract = {Depredation is a human-wildlife interaction over access to resources, which often includes a combination of socioeconomic , ecological and conservation issues. However, estimating the amount of resource depredated can be especially challenging when depredation occurs on fish in the marine environment. This is the case for killer whales (Orcinus orca) and sperm whales (Physeter macrocephalus) depredation on the demersal Patagonian toothfish (Dissostichus eleginoides) longline fishery operating within the Crozet Islands EEZ (southern Indian Ocean). This study aimed at providing two indirect methods of assessment of depredated biomass over an 11-year period (2003 to 2013), accounting for spatial variations of depredation levels. In the first method, fishing data from 6 525 longline sets were used to calculate the difference between catch-per-unit-effort (CPUE) of non-depredated and depredated lines. When killer whales and sperm whales occurred separately, 575 ± 35 tonnes and 739 ± 87 tonnes of Patagonian toothfish respectively were estimated to be depredated by the two species. When the two species co-occurred around vessels, 1 679 ± 74 tonnes were depredated. The second method used the differences in the proportion of grenadiers (Macrourus spp.) between non-depredated and depredated longline sets to estimate the number of depredated Patagonian toothfish. This approach, which can only be implemented when a sufficient level of by-catch species occurs, provides comparable results and thus strong support for the CPUE method. From these two methods, depredation rates were estimated to range from 27.3% to 29.1% of the total catch (landed and depredated), which is one of the highest among all similar situations where depredation is reported elsewhere in the world. In addition to providing a methodology that could be used in other areas with depredation issues, these findings emphasise the critical importance for fishery managers and researchers to account for depredation when assessing fish stocks, fishery economics and/or conservation of odontocetes.

This study advances our understanding of the impact of whale depredation on the commercial sablefish (Anoplopoma fimbria) fishery in Alaska and evaluates the impact depredation may have on the annual federal sablefish assessment. A statistical modelling approach was used to estimate the whale effect on commercial sablefish fishery catch rates; killer whale depredation was more severe (catch rates declined by 45%-70%) than sperm whale depredation (24%-29%). Total estimated sablefish catch removals 1995-2014 ranged from 1251 t to 2407 t by killer whales in western Alaska management areas and 482 t to 1040 t by sperm whales in the Gulf of Alaska 2001-2014. Including sablefish mortality due to whale depredation on the commercial fishery in the sablefish stock assessment resulted in a 1% reduction in the recommended quota. Accounting for sablefish mortality due to whale depredation in the commercial fishery in the sablefish assessment will occur tandem with correcting for depredation on the annual National Marine Fisheries Service longline survey, the primary survey index used in the assessment.},

   abstract = {Depredation, the partial or complete removal of hooked fish (prey) by a nontarget predator species, is a cryptic interaction that negatively affects predators, prey, and fishing industries. However, these interactions are rarely observed, rendering positive identification of the predator nearly impossible. We therefore tested a genetic method for predator identification. Depredated remains from sharks and bony fish were sampled with buccal swabs. Genetic material was isolated from the swabs, which we hypothesized contained oral cells from the predator. A portion of the cytochrome-c oxidase subunit I locus was amplified using prey-specific blocking primers and sequenced in high depth using a metagenetics approach. We sequenced haplotypes from the remains of four sharks, where the predator was visually confirmed, and four bony fish, where the predator was unknown. For all interactions with known predators, our technique suggested the correct predator species. For all interactions where the predators were unknown, our technique suggested species previously confirmed as perpetrators in depredation events. Our findings provide a basis for the development of a genetic technique for predator identification, while highlighting challenges to be overcome before predator identification can be applied to large-scale fisheries.},

   abstract = {Ecosystem-based approaches are increasingly used in fisheries management to account for the direct trophic impacts of fish population harvesting. However, fisheries can also indirectly alter ecosystem structure and functioning, for instance via the provision of new feeding opportunities to marine predators. For instance, marine depredation, where predators feed on fishery catches on fishing gear, is a behaviour developed by many marine species globally. This behaviour can modify both the ecological role of predators and fisheries performance. Yet, these ecosystem-wide effects of depredation are rarely considered holistically. In this study, we explored different ways of incorporating depredation into an Ecopath trophic model. We assessed, through a subantarctic case study, how three alternative model structures can account for depredation effects on fishery catches, predator and non-commercial prey populations, as well as target fish stocks. While none adequately addresses all facets of depredation, the alternative models can to some extent capture how depredation can lead to increased fishing pressure on stocks. As structural specificities of Ecopath prevented us from representing other depredation effects such as provisioning effects for predator populations, we conclude this study with a set of guidance to effectively capture the complex effects of depredation in marine ecosystems and fisheries models.},

   abstract = {Fishers aim to optimise cost–benefit ratios of their behaviour when exploiting resources. Avoidance of interactions with marine predators (i.e. their feeding on catches in fishing gear, known as depredation) has recently become an important component of their decisions. How fishers minimise these interactions whilst maximising fishing success is poorly understood. This issue is addressed in a sub-Antarctic, long-line fishery confronted with extensive depredation by sperm whales Physeter macrocephalus and killer whales Orcinus orca by examining a 15-year data set. Whereas a broad range of behaviours was identified from spatio-temporal and operational descriptors, none combined high fishing success with low frequency of interactions. With experience, fishers favoured exploitation of productive patches with high frequencies of interactions over avoidance behaviours. Such decisions, although potentially optimal in the short term, are likely to intensify pressures on fish stocks and impact depredating whales. Therefore, the present study provides additional evidence to inform management decisions pertaining to the coexistence between fisheries and marine predators.},

   abstract = {The sustainable mitigation of human–wildlife conflicts has become a major societal and environmental challenge globally. Among these conflicts, large marine predators feeding on fisheries catches, a behaviour termed “depredation,” has emerged concomitantly with the expansion of the world’s fisheries. Depredation poses threats to both the socio-economic viability of fisheries and species conservation, stressing the need for mitigation. This review synthesizes the extent and socio-ecological impacts of depredation by sharks and marine mammals across the world, and the various approaches used to minimize it. Depredation was reported in 214 fisheries between 1979 and 2019 (70% post-2000) and affected fleets from 44 countries, in all sectors (commercial, artisanal and recreational), and in all major fishing techniques (nets, traps and hook-and-lines). A total of 68 predator species were involved in depredation (20 odontocetes, 21 pinnipeds and 27 sharks), and most (73%) were subject to either by-catch and/or retaliatory killing from fishers when interacting with gear. Impacts on fishers were primarily associated with catch losses and gear damage but often lacked assessments. Deterrence was a major mitigation approach but also the least effective. Gear modifications or behavioural adaptation by fishers were more promising. This review highlights the need for improved monitoring, and interdisciplinary and integrated research to quantify the determinants and impacts of depredation in the socio-ecological dimension. More importantly, as the conflict is likely to escalate, efforts directed towards changing perceptions and integrating knowledge through adaptive co-management are raised as key directions towards coexistence between fisheries and large marine predators.},

   abstract = {California sea lions (Zalophus californianus) off the coast of Southern California are known to damage both commercial and recreational fishing activities, causing decreases to fish catch and damage to gear. Their increasing population has intensified the potential for conflict between sea lions and anglers, likely requiring changes to current legislation. The recreational fishing community in Southern California is a valuable and largely underutilized source for information and potential solutions to management and legislative problems. This recreational fishing survey-based study conducted in 2013 utilized personal interviews, conducted in the field with recreational anglers and commercial passenger fishing vessel (CPFV) crews in Southern California, to gather data on: (a) the occurrence and impact of sea lion depredation on the local fishing, (b) angler awareness and opinions on current legislation, and (c) the conflict between fishing activities and conservation efforts. Results show that surveyed CPFV operators and private boaters had the most conflict with sea lions and perceive them as more of a problem than anglers on piers, jetties or kayaks. The conflict was also reportedly more prevalent in San Diego County compared to the other counties surveyed (Orange, Los Angeles and Ventura). Participating CPFV operators were overwhelmingly in support of a government culling program for sea lions, while recreational angler respondents did not feel that a control program was necessary. These CPFV operators reported more money lost, and were willing to pay more for an effective deterrent device. There was also a consensus among respondents that fish catch is declining, yet anglers were unsatisfied with the effectiveness of current legislation designed to increase fish stocks. These data will provide a better understanding of California sea lion depredation in Southern California and its effect on recreational anglers in order to aid future mitigation efforts. Additionally, these results provide stakeholder feedback on local marine protected areas and other fisheries management legislation, and build a foundation for future conservation and education programs.},

This study uses National Marine Fisheries Service longline survey data from 1998-2011 to explore spatial and temporal trends in killer whale depredation and to quantify the effect of killer whale depredation on catches of six groundfish species within three management areas in Alaska: the Bering Sea, Aleutian Islands and Western Gulf of Alaska. When killer whales were present during survey gear retrieval, whales removed an estimated 54-72% of sablefish (Anoplopoma fimbria), 41-84% of arrowtooth flounder (Atheresthes stomias) and 73% (Bering Sea only) of Greenland turbot (Reinhardtius hippoglossoides).

Overall catches (depredated and non-depredated sets) for all groundfish species significantly impacted by killer whale depredation were lower by 9-28% (p < 0.05). Effects on shortspine thornyhead (Sebastolobus alascanus) catches were not significant in any management area (p > 0.05).

   abstract = {Depredation is defined as the damage or removal of fish from fishing gear by predators, and is a crucial issue leading to negative impacts on both animals involved in depredation and fisheries. Depredation in longline pelagic fisheries targeting swordfish (Xiphias gladius) and tuna (Thunnus spp.) involves short-finned pilot whales (Globicephala macrorhynchus), false killer whales (Pseudorca crassidens) and some pelagic sharks. Since no long-term solution could be found to date, we investigated fishing gear improvement by deploying a technology designed to physically protect the hooked fish by hiding it to predators: the DMD (depredation mitigation device). Two types of DMDs were designed: "spiders" and "socks". The efficiency of "spiders" was tested in November 2007 during a fishing trial of 26 longline fishing operations when 12,480 hooks and 1970 devices were set. The efficiency of "socks" was tested in October 2008 during a fishing trial of 32 longline fishing operations when 13,220 hooks and 339 devices were set. 117 and 24 fish were hooked on branchlines equipped with spiders and socks, respectively and among those devices, 87.3% versus 69.2% were correctly triggered and 80% versus 15% of the fish were correctly protected. A low entanglement rate of the spiders with the fishing gear was found (3.6%), but a higher one was associated to the socks (17.8%). Operational constraints to routinely deploy "spiders" were examined. The number of sets impacted by shark depredation was significantly greater than the number of sets involving toothed whale depredation. However, when depredation occurred, the proportion of fish damaged by toothed whales was significantly greater. While more trials should be carried out to deeply verify the efficiency of DMDs, we remain convinced that considerations of fishing gear technologies might be more actively investigated to propose innovative measures to mitigate toothed whale depredation in pelagic longlining. For this type of gear, innovative technology is an important issue of the ecosystem approach to fisheries (EAF) framework. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

   abstract = {Direct interactions with fisheries are broadly recognized as the leading conservation threat to small cetaceans. In open-ocean environments, one of the primary gear types implicated in these interactions is the pelagic longline. Unlike accidental entanglement in driftnets or deliberate entrapment by purse-seines, interactions between cetaceans and longlines are often driven by attraction of the animals to feed on bait or fish secured on the gear, a behavior known as depredation. Many small and medium-sized delphinid species have learned to exploit such opportunities, leading to economic costs to fisheries and a risk of mortality to the animals from either retaliation by fishermen or hooking or entanglement in fishing gear. Two pelagic longline fisheries in the United States experience depredation and bycatch by odontocete depredators: the Hawai‘i deep-set longline fishery, which is depredated primarily by false killer whales (Pseudorca crassidens), and the Atlantic pelagic longline fishery depredated primarily by short-finned pilot whales (Globicephala macrorhynchus). These fisheries are among the most intensively documented and managed pelagic longline fisheries in the world, with high levels of observer coverage, and bycatch mitigation measures required to reduce the mortality of seabirds, sea turtles and cetaceans. Both fisheries have active, multi-stakeholder “Take Reduction Teams,” enacted under the U.S. Marine Mammal Protection Act (MMPA), that are tasked to develop measures to reduce the bycatch of cetaceans below statutory reference points. Consequently, these two Teams represent model processes within which to address depredation and bycatch, having access to detailed, high-quality data on the nature and frequency of interactions with cetaceans, meaningful stakeholder involvement, resources to test potential solutions, and the institutional will to improve outcomes. We review how mitigation strategies have been considered, developed, and implemented by both Teams and provide a critical analysis of their effectiveness in addressing these problems. Notably, in the absence of straightforward avoidance or deterrence strategies, both Teams have developed gear and handling strategies that depend critically on comprehensive observer coverage. Lessons offered from these Teams, which have implemented consensus-driven management measures under a statutory framework, provide important insights to managers and scientists addressing other depredation problems.},

   abstract = {Large marine predators feeding on fish caught on fishing gear, a behaviour termed as depredation, can incur socio-economic costs for fisheries and have serious implications on the depredating species, fish stocks and associated ecosystems. The quantity of depredated fish as well as the quantity of depredated fish relative to the retained catch dictates the severity of these impacts, yet these depredated quantities are often unknown due to the complexity of assessing depredation. This is the case for many demersal longline fisheries experiencing depredation by killer whales (Orcinus orca), which remove entire fish from hooks when interacting with the fishing gear. In the present study, we used Generalized Linear Models fitted to the Catch per Unit Effort (CPUE) to quantify killer whale depredation in the blue-eye trevalla (Hyperoglyphe antarctica) commercial longline fishery of south-east Australia. Our results showed that during days when killer whales were present around fishing vessels (7.3% of total fishing days), blue-eye trevalla CPUE decreased by 45.6%. Killer whales were estimated to have removed a total of 63.9 t (95% CI: 45.3–82.7 t) of blue-eye trevalla from the hooks between 2006 and 2017, with a mean removal of 5.3 t (3.8–6.9 t) per year. The mean rate of killer whale depredation in south-east Australia was estimated to be 5.2% (4.0–6.4%) for the entire study period. We estimated that the current depredation rate equates to an additional 27 fishing days per year across the fishery. This figure grows to 354 additional fishing days if depredation was assumed to occur during every fishing operation. Considering that killer whale observations are voluntarily reported in logbooks, this likely underestimates the depredation in our study. Together, these findings suggest that the impacts of killer whale depredation in the blue-eye trevalla fishery of south-east Australia are not negligible given the small scale of the fishery and the historical decline of its catches in this region. We recommend estimates provided in this study to be used as baselines for the future assessment and management of the blue-eye trevalla stocks and for assessing the socio-economic and ecological implications of this issue. In addition, regardless of the limitations associated with assessing depredation, our study also highlights the importance of cross-sectoral and interdisciplinary collaborations between scientists, fishers and fishery managers for effectively improving the management of commercially important fisheries globally.},

   abstract = {Shark encounters while fishing in Western Australian waters have been perceived to be increasing by some fishers in recent years. A lack of quantitative information remains a significant obstacle to determining the nature and magnitude of these encounters. A probability-based survey was implemented to assess the occurrence of and attitudes toward shark encounters by commercial fishers, charter tour operators and private boat-based recreational fishers during 2015/16. Of the 906 fishers interviewed, 52% indicated they had experienced at least one shark encounter while fishing during the previous year. The loss or damage of fish was involved in over half of these encounters while charter fishing and nearly a third while recreational fishing. The level of concern towards shark depredation was highest among charter tour operators state-wide and all sectors in the Gascoyne bioregion. Multiple logistic regression analyses indicated fishing method and bioregion were the most important predictors of encounters. Depredation through fish loss below or at the surface was highest for pelagic or demersal line fishing in the North Coast and Gascoyne bioregions. Overwhelmingly, the majority of fishers in all sectors were satisfied with their fishing experience despite the occurrence of shark encounters. Future research on shark depredation would benefit from focusing on fishing methods and bioregions where depredation events were highest, with consideration of associated behavioural and environmental characteristics likely to influence depredation rates. The approach outlined here could easily be applied to other human-wildlife interaction studies where representative views of stakeholders are required for policy development and effective management.},

   abstract = {The loss of hooked fish from shark depredation has become an increasing problem in marine recreational fisheries worldwide, particularly among charter and private-boat recreational fishers. There is growing need to understand the prevalence of shark encounters, where depredation occurs and how recreational fishers respond to and mitigate depredation. This study of 1340 charter and private-boat recreational fishers in north-western Australia, included both probability-based (telephone and online) and opt-in (online) survey methods and is the first to document mitigation methods used by recreational fishers. More than half of the respondents (728) who completed the survey indicated that they had attempted to mitigate depredation. In the probability-based survey, the main mitigation methods reported by charter and private-boat fishers were to move spots, use wire trace or stop fishing. Depredation evokes strong opinions from some sections of the fishing population. Although more avid fishers self-selected for the opt-in surveys, the inclusion of information from these respondents, particularly from open-ended questions, provided detailed information on attitudes among fishers where this issue is of concern. This study highlights the wide range of views and concerns regarding depredation, all of which need to be considered when developing policies and guidelines around this issue. As with other contentious issues where changes in fishing behaviour are required, decision-makers will need to devise strategies to inform and educate the fishing public in how to mitigate against depredation.},

   abstract = {Shark depredation, where a shark partially or completely consumes an animal caught by fishing gear before it can be retrieved to the fishing vessel, occurs in commercial and recreational fisheries worldwide, causing a range of negative biological and economic impacts. Despite this, it remains relatively understudied compared to other fisheries issues. This is the first review of the literature relating to shark depredation, which also includes an overview of the potential mechanisms underlying its occurrence and options for mitigation. Furthermore, this review highlights key research gaps that remain to be investigated, thereby providing impetus for future research. In total, 61 studies have been published between 1955 and 2018, which include information on shark depredation. These studies recorded quantitative rates of depredation between 0.9 and 26% in commercial and recreational fisheries and during research fishing, identified 27 shark species from seven families that were responsible for depredation and discussed potential factors influencing its occurrence. Information from research into bycatch mitigation and the testing of shark deterrent approaches and technologies is also presented, in the context of applying these approaches to the reduction of shark depredation. This review presents an holistic overview of shark depredation in fisheries globally and, in doing so, provides a central resource for fisheries researchers and managers focusing on this topic to stimulate further collaborative research on this important fisheries issue.},

   abstract = {Killer whale (Orcinus orca) depredation (whales stealing or damaging fish caught on fishing gear) adversely impacts demersal longline fisheries for sablefish ( Anoplopoma fimbria), Pacific halibut (Hippoglossus stenolepis ) and Greenland turbot (Reinhardtius hippoglossoides) in the Bering Sea, Aleutian Islands and Western Gulf of Alaska. These interactions increase direct costs and opportunity costs associated with catching fish and reduce the profitability of longline fishing in western Alaska. This study synthesizes National Marine Fisheries Service observer data, National Marine Fisheries Service sablefish longline survey and fishermen-collected depredation data to: 1) estimate the frequency of killer whale depredation on longline fisheries in Alaska; 2) estimate depredation-related catch per unit effort reductions; and 3) assess direct costs and opportunity costs incurred by longliners in western Alaska as a result of killer whale interactions. The percentage of commercial fishery sets affected by killer whales was highest in the Bering Sea fisheries for: sablefish (21.4%), Greenland turbot (9.9%), and Pacific halibut (6.9%). Average catch per unit effort reductions on depredated sets ranged from 35.1- 69.3% for the observed longline fleet in all three management areas from 1998-2012 (p<0.001). To compensate for depredation, fishermen set additional gear to catch the same amount of fish, and this increased fuel costs by an additional 82% per depredated set (average $ 433 additional fuel per depredated set). In a separate analysis with six longline vessels in 2011and 2012, killer whale depredation avoidance measures resulted in an average additional cost of $ 494 per depredated vessel-day for fuel and crew food. Opportunity costs of time lost by fishermen averaged $522 per additional vessel-day on the grounds. This assessment of killer whale depredation costs represents the most extensive economic evaluation of this issue in Alaska to date and will help longline fishermen and managers consider the costs and benefits of depredation avoidance and alternative policy solutions. © 2014 Peterson et al.},

   abstract = {Marine predators feeding on fisheries catches directly on the fishing gear, a behaviour termed “depredation”, has emerged as a major human-wildlife conflict globally, often resulting in substantial socio-economic and ecological impacts. This study investigated the extent of this conflict in commercial Patagonian toothfish (Dissostichus eleginoides) fisheries across subantarctic waters where both killer whales (Orcinus orca) and sperm whales (Physeter macrocephalus) feed on toothfish caught on longline hooks. Using long-term datasets from six major fishing areas, from southern Chile to the Indian Ocean sector of the Southern Ocean, statistical models were developed to quantify the catch removals due to whale depredation interactions. The results indicated that these removals were large, totalling more than 6600 t of toothfish between 2009 and 2016 with an annual mean of 837 t [95% CI 480–1195 t], comprised of 317 t [232–403 t] and 518 t [247–790 t] removed by killer whales and sperm whales, respectively. Catch removals greatly varied between areas, with the largest estimates found at Crozet, where on average 279 t [179–379 t] of toothfish per year, equivalent to 30% [21–37%] of the total catches. Together, these findings provide metrics to assess the impacts of depredation interactions on the fishing industry, whale populations, fish stocks and associated ecosystems. With an estimated $15 M USD worth of fish depredated every year, this study highlights the large geographic scale and economic significance of the depredation issue and its potential to compromise the viability of some toothfish fisheries which are the primary socio-economic activity in subantarctic regions.},

   abstract = {Shark depredation, the full or partial removal of a hooked fish by a shark before it is landed, is anecdotally increasing in the United States. Perceptions of depredation by anglers and fishing guides may influence their behavior and have cascading effects on sharks and recreational fisheries. However, to date, these perceptions have not been broadly quantified. To better understand how anglers and guides respond to shark depredation in recreational fisheries, we used an online survey open to saltwater anglers in North America, distributed electronically via social media and online platforms. Of the 541 respondents, 77% had experienced depredation in nearshore and pelagic fisheries in the last five years, with depredation more commonly reported in the southeastern United States. Emotional responses to depredation were significantly different between anglers and guides, with the latter feeling more intense negative emotions. Behavioral changes in response to depredation, such as targeting and harvesting sharks, were driven largely by negative emotional responses and perceptions of sharks as threats to target species, while changes to protect target species varied with positive emotional responses and angler demographics. Guides were predominantly concerned about increased mortality to their target species and loss of trophy fish from the population. In fact, 87% of guides experienced depredation when fishing with clients and overwhelmingly reported that depredation has a negative effect on their livelihood. Overall, these results can be used to help inform strategies to reduce depredation while accounting for the values of stakeholder groups, particularly anglers and those advocating for shark conservation.},
